By Salisu Sani-Idris The FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, has admonished Nigerian children to imbibe the virtues of integrity, honesty, hard work, discipline, a deep sense of patriotism and love for the  country. The Minister made the call on Thursday in his message of felicitation to the children on the celebration of the 2021 National Children Day in Abuja. He reminded the children that as national and global leaders of the future with the desire to ensure the greatness of Nigeria and also excel in their chosen fields of endeavor, it was essential that they embraced these character traits. He also charged them to shun all acts that might negatively impact their future such as cultism, immoral behavior, disrespect for authority, drug abuse, and online criminal activities amongst others. Similarly, the minister called on the children to follow the footsteps of the many positive role models in the country. Bello equally enjoined the children not to be negatively influenced by social vices they encounter everyday especially, via the social media. He reminded them that the road to success was paved with hard work, perseverance, dedication and commitment. Acccording to the minister, any short cut taken will lead to failure and possibly regret. Bello, who, admonished children to be patriotic at all times and love and honour Nigeria, called on them to always work in harmony for the benefit of the country. “You have no other country but Nigeria and as residents of the FCT, you have an obligation to live together in peace and harmony as envisaged by our founding fathers”, the Minister said. On the theme for the 2021 Children’s Day Celebrations which is “The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Total Wellbeing of the Nigerian Child: The Way Forward, ” Bello said that the pandemic indeed has a negative effect on the children as it disrupted their academic pursuits. ” The pandemic also deprived them of normal social interactions with their peers and even took the lives of some of their loved ones.” He, however, praised the Nigerian children and youths for their resilience in the face of the challenges caused by the pandemic. The minister noted that the pandemic was not yet over and called on them to continue to adhere to the non-pharmaceutical protocols which includes hand washing, facial covering and physical distancing. Bello, therefore, called on parents to always ensure the wellbeing and welfare of their children, while assuring them of the commitment of the FCT Administration in meeting all its obligations to the Nigerian child. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that May 27 is traditionally the Children’s day in Nigeria.
