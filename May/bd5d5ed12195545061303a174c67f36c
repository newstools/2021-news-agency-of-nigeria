This is evident in what we are seeing. The advance party went ahead to fine tune all arrangements. “This is a mark of the commitment of the Honourable Minister to ensure a hitch-free event and podium success in Tokyo,” he said. Beyioku further affirmed that the Athletes had trained well and were motivated to make the country proud. “All the COVID-19  protocols for a successful trip have been carried out. “To underscore the importance of the trip, the Minister lived up to his promise to see the athletes off, to motivate them, to make Nigeria proud by qualifying for the Olympics and win medals. “The team will take part in the first relay on May 9,” he said.
