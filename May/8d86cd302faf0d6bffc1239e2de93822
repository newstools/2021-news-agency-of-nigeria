In a condolence message, the Governor described the death of the Prince as heartbreaking and devastating and condoled with the Emir and the people of Kontagora Emirate over. A statement by Mary Noel-Berne, Bello’s spokesperson, said the governor said ” it is really disheartening to hear about the death of Bashir, especially at a time when intense Military operations are on going in some parts of the state to rid the State of criminal elements”. According to the Governor, “as painful as the death is, the situation will only spur my administration to ensure that the fight against banditry in the state is won. My deepest condolence goes to the Emir and the people of Kontagora Emirate as this is indeed a great loss but we should all be consoled by the fact that it is a necessary end for all mortals”. The Governor prayed God to forgive all the shortcomings of the deceased and grant them Aljannah Firdausi as well as give the Emir, people of the Emirate, and close associates the fortitude to bear the loss.
