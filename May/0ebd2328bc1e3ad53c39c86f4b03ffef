By Nefishetu Yakubu Former Speaker Edo State House of Assembly Adjoto Kabiru and former All Progressives Congress (APC) Chairman in Edo Anslem Ojezua on Friday said that Gov. Godwin Obaseki ‘s victory at the supreme court will further strengthen democracy in Nigeria. Kabiru was reacting to the Supreme Court verdict which upheld the judgment of the Appeal Court on Obaseki’s alleged certificate forgery. Kabiru told newsmen in Benin that the judgment was victory for democracy and the people of Edo Kabiru said ” it goes to show that the judiciary is not only the hope of the common man but also for the elites. “It gives us absolute confidence in the judiciary and will go a long way to strengthen democracy in Nigeria. “I am happy for Edo people and the Peoples Democratic party (PDP),” Kabiru said. Anslem Ojezua, former APC chairman in Edo, said the supreme court victory would solidify the governor Obaseki’s mandate and also raise the responsibilities attached to the mandate. Ojezua who had since defected to the PDP said, “so much is expected of him at this point. The people spoke and they were in his favour. “The judiciary has spoken and also spoke in his favour. So, it is now up to him to justify that confidence. “The truth is that the issue was foregone, anything that is predicated on falsehood must fail. “Meanwhile, the institution that issued the certificate came to court to defend it. “What is even worse for them (accusers) is that somebody claims to know what forgery is even while he didn’t see the original document. “How do you know there is forgery if you have no knowledge of the document itself. From day one they did not stand the chance. According to Ojezua, thank God justice has been served. Also speaking, Mr Henry Idahagbon, a lawyer and chieftain of the APC, prayed God to give Obaseki wisdom to deliver the dividend of democracy to Edo people. “Well, there is no problem, it is time to rebuild Edo; I believe our party, the All Progressives Congress and we should go back to the drawing board and rebuild the party. “We have lost at the Supreme Court and Obaseki has won and we wish him well. “And we pray that God should give him the wisdom to deliver the dividends of democracy to Edo people,” Idahagbon said. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Supreme Court on Friday upheld the ruling of the Appeal Court dismissing the alleged certificate forgery suit filed by the APC against Obaseki. The verdict affirmed the victory of governor at the Sept. 19, polls.(NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
