Welcoming dignitaries to the special exhibition, the Director-General, National Gallery of Art (NGA), Ebeten Ivara, remarked that he was humbled that “today we have in our midst a living legend in the visual arts sub-sector’’ At 92, he said Barber “is as relevant to the sector as he was when he started out more than four decades ago as a youngster’’. Ivara noted that going through the art book on the “foremost artist” was very enlightening. “I must say that going through the book on this foremost artist was very enlightening. “One of the interesting aspects of his life is his penchant for self-improvement and appetite to hone his innate skill as an artist. “He was never satisfied as he always yearned for more and by so doing blazed a trail even with little formal education. “This is a lesson for a younger generation. “I urge all of you to get out of your comfort zone and strive to improve whatever skill you have,’’ the director-general said.
