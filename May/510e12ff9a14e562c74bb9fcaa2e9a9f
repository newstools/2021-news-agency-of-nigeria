By Peter Uwumarogie Adamawa United Football Club’s Head Coach, Justin Madugu, has commended his team’s performance against Warri Wolves Football Club in their six-goal thriller at the Pantami Stadium in Gombe on Sunday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Yola-based hosts came from behind thrice to draw 3-3 against the visiting Warri Wolves. The game was a Match Day 22 fixture of the 2020/2021 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). Madugu told newsmen in a post-match conference that he appreciated his boys for the efforts they exerted in the match and “even the performance was good. “You can see the spirit with which the boys were fighting. They came back thrice and even had the opportunity to clinch the winner but it didn’t just work out.” He, however, decried the three goals his boys conceded blaming it on inexperience while stressing that they were still learning and getting better with every match. On the mistake by goalkeeper Abdullahi Abdulwahab, which resulted in Adamawa United conceding the second goal, Madugu said: “Football is a human game and people are bound to make mistakes. “He is a human being and we cannot kill him. We will also need him for tomorrow.” On the match’s officiating, the coach said his job was not to analyse match officials but the mistakes of his boys and how he could correct them in subsequent matches. “If all the chances we had were converted, we will not be talking about officiating,” he said. On his part, the coach of Warri Wolves, Deniran Tega, who also gave kudos to his boys, said he expected his team to have won the match having taken the lead thrice. Tega said the match was a good one as his team played “really good”, but said he would go back home to work on his defence and “how we can score more goals ahead of our next match.” While expressing his dissatisfaction with some of the decisions made by the match referee, the Warri Wolves coach noted that there was room for improvement as the league progresses. NAN reports that the hosts got their goals through Anayo Ogbonna who got a brace in the ninth and 32nd minutes, while Idris Abubakar scored the third in the 78th minute. Warri Wolves’ goals came through Otu Stanley in the second minute, Williams Sunday in the 26th minute while Efe Yarhere got the third in the 49th minute of the game.
