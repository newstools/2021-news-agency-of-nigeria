Hong Kong has witnessed no new local infection of COVID-19 for two straight days as the epidemic remained under control. There was one imported case reported on Tuesday, taking the tally in the financial hub to 11,826, Hong Kong’s Centre for Health Protection said. Hong Kong has tightened anti-epidemic measures for travelers from several countries including Argentina, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Singapore with longer quarantine time, as the COVID-19 spreading risk was higher in those places. Under an ongoing vaccination programme, more than 1.98 million vaccine doses have been administered in Hong Kong, with 803,800 people fully vaccinated.
