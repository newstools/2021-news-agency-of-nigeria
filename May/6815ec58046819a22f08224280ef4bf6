Specifically, the capitalisation which opened at N20.830 trillion dipped N193 billion to close at N20. 637 trillion. Similarly, the All-Share Index lost 367.97 points or 0.92 per cent to close at 39,433.81 from 39,801.78 on Tuesday. Consequently, month-to-date and year-to-date losses increased to 0.9 per cent and 2.0 per cent, respectively. The price depreciation was sustained by sell-off in Stanbic IBTC Holdings and 21 other stocks. The loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Unilever Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank, Zenith Bank and Julius Berger. Analysts at Afrinvest Ltd. attributed the development to rising yields in the fixed income securities. “We expect the market performance to remain bearish in the next trading session, as investors continue to take position in the fixed income space due to rising yields,” they said.
