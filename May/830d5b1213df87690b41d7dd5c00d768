By Emmanuella Anokam The National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANTS) has appealed to Enugu and Lagos Governments to deploy resources to assist traders affected by market fire outbreaks in both states. NANTS President, Dr Ken Ukaoha, who made the appeal in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, said while seeking intervention, the government should also quickly reconstruct the burnt markets. Ukaoha urged the Federal Government to come to the aid of the traders who were currently nursing the wounds inflicted by COVID-19, and many of who had yet to see any means of assistance, including COVID-19 palliatives. He said that government should not allow law-abiding citizens, especially the vulnerable, to remain under such double affliction. According to him, it is time for the Ministry and Agencies in charge of disaster management to step in immediately and do the needful. Ukaoha noted that while such necessary intervention was coming, the association expected that investigation to unravel the causes should be conducted. The Enugu fire outbreak occurred on May 29, in Ogbete Main Market, while that of Lagos occurred on Sunday in Ladipo Spare Parts Market in Oshodi. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that million of naira  worth of goods were lost to both fire incidents in Lagos and Enugu. “NANTS is overwhelmed by these tragedies. We deeply sympathise with all our members in these markets who are the victims of the fire incidents. “We call on all our members to remain calm while we seek ways to invite government’s urgent attention to these unbearable disasters,” he said.
