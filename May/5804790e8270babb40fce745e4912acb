By Kadiri Abdulrahman A political group, Tinubu Vanguard, on Saturday called on Nigerians to imbibe the culture of philanthropy. The group charged Nigerians to be their “brothers’ keeper” as the country tackled economic and security challenges. The Director-General of the Tinubu Vanguard, Dr Johnny Benjamin, gave the charge in the Abuja National Mosque at the sideline of distribution of food items to indigent members of the society. Benjamin said that the idea of food distribution was to identify with poor Muslim brethren in the aftermath of the 30 days Ramadan fasting and Eid celebrations. He called on Nigerians to break ethnic and religious barriers and forge a common front to tackle various national challenges. “This exercise is a mark of solidarity and support for the less privileged members of the Muslim community,” he said. The director-general of the organisation criticised the lingering security challenges across the country. He, however, commended the government and security agencies for their efforts to restore law and order. The National Secretary of the group, Mr Jacob Obi, urged the beneficiaries of the humanitarian gesture to reflect and practice all the lessons learnt during Ramadan. The group offered prayers for security and peaceful coexistence in the country.
