By Francisca Oluyole Alhaji Kabiru Kankara, President, Miners Association of Nigeria, has advised affected miners in Zamfara to stay away from their mining sites, until the Federal Government lift its ban. Kankara gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Abuja. The Federal government recently declared that artisanal or small scale miners should vacate all mining sites due to insecurity in the state. The Federal government on March 2 also announced a complete ban on mining activities as well as declared the State a “no fly zone.” “Our members can take unnecessary risk; they can dare government directive. My advise is that, affected miners should stay away from their mining sites until government announce lifting of the ban.” Kankara called on the Federal government to improve on security situation in Zamfara to enable miners return to their legitimate businesses. According to him, it is not government’s wish to make miners stay away from their mining activities, especially now that government placed gold on its priority list. ”We, the executives of the association are making efforts to meet with all officials and security personnel to ensure all mining sites in the state are safe before our members can resume mining activities.
