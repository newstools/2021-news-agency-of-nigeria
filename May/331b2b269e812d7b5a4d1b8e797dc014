Philip was at it again as he showed poise against a more superior opponent to produce another upset in the second round of the men’s singles event. “It’s an amazing feeling. I am learning what it is like to be under pressure. I’m learning a lot and I’m really thankful for this experience. “I am now hungry for results more than ever in every match I play, no matter who my opponent is. It really doesn’t bother me anymore. “I just want to play my best tennis out there and let my racket do the talking for me when it’s all said and done. “I hope I can continue to push and enjoy this amazing winning run,” an excited Philip told NAN after the game.
