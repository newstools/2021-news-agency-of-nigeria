By Deji Abdulwahab Dr Amobi Nwokafor, a governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra, says his main target if elected as a governor will be on poverty eradication in the state. Nwokafor, who is an Accountant and an industrialist, made the pledge on Wednesday while speaking with newsmen in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that APC primary election will hold in June, while the Anambra governorship election holds on Nov. 6. The aspirant, who said most leaders did not prepare for leadership to deliver good governance, said that he had prepared himself with a vision to lead Anambra. “I am offering myself to govern Anambra State with the focus to eradicate poverty and unemployment because l have prepared to do so. “l decided to offer myself to serve because of the gap between doing well and not doing well of States and people in Nigeria. “Doing well in the sense that if you are a good leader, you will be able to provide the needful for the society to grow and for humanity to be happy,” he said. Nwokafor said that Anambra had an infrastructure deficit since the state was created 30 years ago. “Our people are looking for somebody to bridge the infrastructure gap in the state,” he said. According to him, there is a need to replace Anambra Government House and Governor’s lodge with new edifices. “The Capital Territory of Anambra today is not defined, there is pressure on the state capital, Akwa. There should be an expansion of the place to accommodate everybody. “In Anambra, we have a well-defined partner of development. For instance, Onitsha, as a town, represents the commercial hub of Anambra. It needs to be further developed. “Nnewi, again by nature and by design, is industrial hub, a leader that has that vision should go further to develop that environment and to provide all the required infrastructure for industrialisation,” he said. Nwokafor also noted that the Northside of Anambra, which is the Agricultural base of the state, needed a leader that has all it takes to develop agriculture to the highest level and made Anambra sufficient in food production. “So, l am prepared by training and by God-given abilities to harness all these and put them into use and make Anambra a viable state,” he said.
