By Emmanuel Afonne The Nigerian community in South Africa has provided succour to a poor South African family living in a dilapidated tin shack with a brand new fully furnished five-bedroom house. The President of the Nigeria Union South Africa (NUSA), Mr Adetola Olubajo, made the disclosure in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja. Olubajo said the house, which also had a borehole, was presented to Ms Muyadziwa Musundwa and her five children, who lived at Maelula village, Tshifhire, South Africa, on May 15. He said: “When one of our Board of Trustee (BoT) members was told of the family’s plight by a local journalist, he was touched as every person deserves better living conditions. “It is our obligation to make sure that even the Musundwa family lived comfortably like other community members. “It is our joint responsibility to eliminate poverty, hunger and underdevelopment within our communities,” Olubajo said, adding that as Africans, we are one irrespective of our geographic location. Mr Femi Adeleke, a BoT member, who presented the house to Musundwas, was quoted in the statement as saying that he was proud to be a part of the “good deeds” aimed at uplifting communities. “We got in touch with Musundwa with the help of a local journalist. “Most of the families we have helped consisted of unemployed people and they needed assistance from our community. “They did not choose to be poor, therefore, they need to be uplifted by those who can do something for them,” he said, noting that the donations were based “on love and brotherhood”. The unemployed Musundwa and her children, who shed tears of joy when the keys to their new home were handed over to them, said they had no shelter before the donation. “We initially thought that people in rural areas are neglected, but we know now that there are people out there who care and we are very thankful,” she said. “God is great! I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would one day have a beautiful house like this one. Life was tough for me and my children. “When it rained we had to sit up the whole night, as there was water all over; sometimes thieves will break in and steal whatever is in the house.” Mr Nehemia Madzhiga of the Makhado Municipality, thanked Adeleke and NUSA for the good work they were doing within the communities. “We are very happy to have Africans, who understand our language and as a government we cannot do things for all our people alone but if other people can identify people in need and assist them, we can do more for our people together,” he said. Ms Thelma Ramabulana, representative of Maelula Royal Council, said there were more challenges ahead, but that they would join hands with NUSA to fight against poverty and underdevelopment.
