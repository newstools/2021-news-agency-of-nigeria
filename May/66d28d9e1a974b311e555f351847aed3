He explained that the country home of a retired senior naval Commodore Iyortyer Afeah, who is from the village, was completely burnt down with the four people who were inside. “Other prominent indigenes of the village whose houses were burnt are, the late wife of Justice Katsina Alu, Mrs Victoria Alu, former Chief Justice of Nigeria CJN, and a retired Deputy Controller- General of Immigration, Mr Denen Akaa”. Yawe said that apart from those killed during the attack, many were receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi. He said further that from what the victims told the ACF, the attack was organised by some bandits from a neighbouring Shitile/Tiv community. “We at the ACF are worried about the rampant loss of lives in Benue and call on security agents to give accurate accounts of security situation as at when due. “We condemn the incessant killings of innocent people of Benue and urge security agencies to investigate properly and ensure that justice was served.
