By Moji Eniola The Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) has advised that Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju James (alias Baba Ijesha), should be charged with child molestation. According to a statement signed by the Attorney-General of Lagos State, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday, a prima-facie case has been established against the actor. “After due consideration of the facts in the case file, the DPP issued legal advice on the 4th of May, 2021,  to the effect that a prima-facie case has been disclosed against Mr Olanrewaju James, and recommended he be charged under the following provisions of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015: “Section 135 –  Indecent Treatment of a Child – punishable by seven years’ imprisonment; Section 137 – Defilement of a Child – punishable with life imprisonment. “Section 261 – Sexual Assault by Penetration – punishable by life imprisonment; Section 262 – Attempted Sexual Assault by Penetration – punishable by 14 years’ imprisonment, and Section 263 – Sexual Assault – punishable by three years’ imprisonment,” the attorney-general said. He said that the state would ensure that James’ rights as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution would be upheld. Onigbanjo said that Lagos State Ministry of Justice would not relent in efforts to ensure that sexual abuse of any resident of the state would be punished. “It is instructive to note that the Lagos State Ministry of Justice has been consistent in its efforts in protecting the vulnerable in our society. “Since the establishment of the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team in 2014, it has, till date, prosecuted over 800 cases of sexual and domestic offences. “The attorney-general hereby assures Lagosians and indeed Nigerians that, in accordance with the DPP’s advice, charges would be filed accordingly,” he said. NAN reports that the police arrested James for alleged sexual abuse of a minor. On April 30, the police forwarded the case file to the DPP for legal advice.
