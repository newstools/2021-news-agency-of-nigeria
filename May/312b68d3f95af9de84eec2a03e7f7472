By Aminu Garko  Dr Bashir Yankuzo, the Chief Imam of Central Mosque of Federal University of Technology, Minna, has called on Nigerians to pray for the unity of the country.  He made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday after saying prayers to mark Eid el-Fitr in Minna.  According to him, the county’s unity is non-negotiable.  He called on Nigerians,  irrespective of religion, ethnicity and political affiliations to pray to God to intervene in the current insecurity challenges facing the country.  Yankuzo also urged Muslims to sustain the exemplary qualities of Prophet Muhammad in their daily pursuits.  “Muslims should use the occasion of Eid el-Fitr to offer prayers for elected leaders as well as those in authority to ensure good democratic governance through divine intervention.  “Muslims should also hold unto the lessons of selflessness, discipline and piety from the just concluded Ramadan to strengthen their faith in praying for peace, security and economic stability of the country.  “We must continue to keep praying for security personnel deployed to fight banditry, kidnapping and insurgency.  ” May Allah give the Federal Government the wisdom to tackle all the problems of insecurity,” Yankuzo said.  He also charged all Nigerians to remain law abiding and embrace the spirit of kindness, tolerance and self-discipline as taught by the prophet to ensure peaceful coexistence among Nigerians.  He called on wealthy Muslims to support the poor in view of the difficulties being faced by Nigerians.  The chief Imam also urged Nigerians to always volunteer reliable and credible information on bad elements in their midst to the nearest security personnel.  “Security matters should not be left in the hands of security personnel alone, hence  the need for us all to be security conscious in what is happening in and around our sorrounding for overall development of security situation in the country,” he said.( NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
