It said this in a document signed by the Director-General, Mr Alex Okoh, and made available to the media on Sunday. The document said that it was in continuation of the ongoing reforms of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry and consistent with the Nigerian Electric Power Policy and Electric Power Sector Reform (EPSR) Act, 2005. It also said that the Board of Directors of Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) and the National Council on Privatisation had approved the sale of the five companies through a competitive bidding process. It however, did not say how much was expected to be realised from the sales. The companies constructed under the NIPP are located in Kogi, Edo, Cross River, Ondo and Ogun.
