By Desmond Ejibas The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has intercepted 1, 387 cartons of Tramadol tablets concealed inside 1,000 cartons of ceramic tiles in Rivers. Mrs Ifeoma Ojukwu, the spokesperson for the Area II Command, Onne Port in Rivers, disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday in Port Harcourt. Ojukwu said that the seizure was made possible with help from international partners. Ojukwu quoted the Area Comptroller, Auwal Mohammed as saying the “prohibited items were found in a 1×40 feet container with registration number MRKU0764717. “The drugs were packed in a 120mg capsule and stored inside 20 sachets per pack, totaling 18 packs per carton. “We discovered that the same carton that is used to package the ceramic tiles was also used to package the tramadol 120mg capsules. “A total of 1, 387 cartons of prohibited tramadol tablets were concealed with 1,000 cartons of ceramic tiles “The drugs were picked through intelligence gathering following a tip-off from an international security network,” Mohammed said. The Comptroller said the importer of the banned substance, agent and their collaborators would soon be prosecuted. He said the command had begun physical examination of the seized goods to enable investigators conduct a thorough job on the consignment. According to him, the command will not succumb to any external pressure to hurry its investigation without following the laid down procedures. “Therefore, every importer should know that making unclear or false electronic declarations does not mean they will have an easy way out with their consignment. “All Customs officers under my watch will continue to abide by the law as well as shun any form of compromise,” he said.
