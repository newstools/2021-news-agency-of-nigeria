By Emmanuel Afonne Chief Felix Anyansi-Agwu, the Chairman of Enyimba International football club of Aba, has expressed optimism of recording positive result in the CAF Confederation Cup first-leg, quarter-final clash with the Pyramids FC of Egypt in Cairo. Anyansi-Agwu expressed the optimisim in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) ahead of Sunday’s first-leg encounter between both teams. He said the target of the Nigerian club is to play in the final and possibly lift the trophy. “This is no longer the group stage, the approach must be different because it is no longer about points, it’s about scoring goals and winning; we have respect for them because at this level if you don’t respect your opponent, you might miss the point. “In as much we have respect for them, I believe they will accord us the same respect but we won’t be carried away just because it’s Pyramids. “This is the knockout stage, any mistake you make you are out, so we are doing everything possible to avoid mistakes that will cost us the semifinals ticket. “They’re from Egypt and a very good team but we are also not a lesser team. We will ensure everyone is focused. “If you talk about experience, both local and international, you can’t take it away from Enyimba, but it doesn’t mean we are God,” Anyansi-Agwu said. According to him, he will be an accomplished man if the Confederation Cup title is added to Enyimba’s list of trophies. “I can’t be satisfied with what I have achieved with Enyimba as far as I am still there. But looking back, I can’t be carried away because I need results. “Even when you play a team 10-0, you’re expected to win the next game regardless of the 10-0, so that is what it is. We want to achieve more. “We want to win the trophy and complete add it to our arsenal of trophies. If you look at everything we have won, Champions League, Super Cup, eight league titles, FA Cup and others, the only one missing is the Confederation cup. “So, it will be an honour and accomplishment for me as an administrator that during my time Enyimba won the title,” he added. NAN reports that the return-leg encounter would be played at the Enyimba Stadium, Aba, on May 23.
