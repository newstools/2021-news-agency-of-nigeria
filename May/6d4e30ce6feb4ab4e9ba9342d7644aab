By Lucy Ogalue Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has appealed to Ghana to support Nigeria’s bid for the seat of Secretary-General for the forthcoming  Maritime Organisation for West and Central Africa (MOWCA) election. Amaechi made the appeal in a statement by the Director,  Press and Public Relations of the Ministry, Mr Eric Ojiekwe on Wednesday in Abuja. The minister  stated this when the Chief Executive Officer, Ghana Shippers Authority (GSA), Benonita Bismarck, who is on a working visit led a delegation to Nigeria visited him in Abuja. Amaechi intimated the delegation that Nigeria had duly adhered and supported the organisation, hence the need for Nigeria to be considered for the post. He called on Ghana to provide Nigeria with the needed support as she will be hosting MOWCA’s next meeting scheduled for July 26 to July 30. The minister, who also expressed Nigeria’s readiness to support the West African Maritime Bank, called on Ghana to key into the initiative. Earlier, the Chief Executive Officer, GSA, Bismarck, said that they were in Nigeria to strengthen collaborative ties between the two countries. Bismarck stated that with ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Zone, there was the urgent need for both nations to work on developing non-trade barriers and trade facilitations. She further spoke on the need to bring Sierra Lone, Gambia and Liberia into MOWCA as the organisation currently had only two anglophone countries with 17 being francophone. Bismarck expressed that hoped that with the minister’s support, these countries could be brought on board.
