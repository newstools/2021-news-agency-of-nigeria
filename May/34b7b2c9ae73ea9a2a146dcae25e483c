By Joshua Olomu The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has urged manufacturers of medical equipment, regulatory institutions and stakeholders in the healthcare sector to maintain accurate measuring instruments. Malam Farouk Salim, Director General of SON, made the call in statement expressing his goodwill on Thursday in Abuja as Nigeria joins the rest of the world in celebration of the 2021 World Metrology Day. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that May 20 is marked annually as World Metrology Day in celebration of the signature of the Metre Convention of 1875 by representatives of 17 nations. The convention set the framework for global collaboration in the science of measurement and in its industrial, commercial and societal applications. Metrology is the science of measurement, embracing both experimental and theoretical determinations at any level of uncertainty in any field of science and technology. The convention set the framework for global collaboration in the science of measurement and in its industrial, commercial and societal applications. The day is to raise awareness on role of metrology, the science of measurement, which plays a central role in scientific discovery and innovation, industrial manufacturing and international trade, in improving the quality of life and in protecting environment. The theme of the 2021 celebration as released by the Bureau International des Poids et Measures (BIPM) and the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) is “Measurement for Health”. Salim stressed the need to ensure that all measuring instruments in the health care delivery sector give accurate values to support medical personnel in delivering quality services. “The theme of this year’s celebration “Measurement for Health” is very much in tune with the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. “It is important to stress the need to ensure that all measuring instruments in the health care delivery sector give accurate values to support medical personnel in delivering quality and life-saving services to our people. “Across the world, national metrology institutes continually advance measurement science by developing and validating new measurement techniques at the necessary level of sophistication. “The International Organisation of Legal Metrology (OIML) also develops international recommendations, which aim to align and harmonise requirements worldwide in many fields. “It also operates the OIML Certification System (OIML-CS) which facilitates international acceptance and global trade of regulated measuring instruments. “As you may be aware, metrology, the science of measurement and accuracy is being coordinated in Nigeria by SON through the activities of the National Metrology Institute (NMI) located in Enugu. “The SON through the NMI is an integral part of and a close collaborator with the above mentioned international metrology bodies on behalf of Nigeria,” he said. He said that the services of the NMI in ensuring accuracy of measurements is being expanded to all parts of Nigeria starting with Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt to bring its services nearer to stakeholders across the country. Salim disclosed that the Management of SON has provided substantial discounts for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) to enjoy the services of the NMI in support of the Federal Government’s economic diversification programme. He further said that local manufacturing of medical equipment and machinery stand to gain a lot in accuracy of measurements from the calibration NMI. The SON Chief Executive stated that the offshore conformity assessment programme for SON regulated imports (SONCAP) provides a window of import permit. He said stakeholders in the healthcare delivery sector should take optimum advantage of it to improve the quality of products and services being offered to Nigerians. Salim therefore called on the public and private sector organisations to take optimum advantage of the capacities being built at the NMI to ensure accuracy of all measuring instruments particularly in the health care delivery sector.(NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
