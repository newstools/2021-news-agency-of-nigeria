By Ikuru Lizzy Rivers State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has restated its commitment to safety as it joined in the United Nations Road Safety Week, tagged ‘Street For Life’. The command’s Sector Commander, Corps Commander Salisu Galadunci, stated this on Wednesday during a courtesy visit to the state office of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) in Port Harcourt. Galadunci said the annual global ceremony, which started on Monday, was programmed by the United Nations as part of efforts toward reducing road traffic crashes. “The United Nations (UN) has rolled out this year’s programme, ‘Street for Life, to effectively promote public enlightenment on safe roads. “As part of the command’s contributions we will be visiting public loading bays, motor garages and religious centres to educate the populace on the UN street for life advisory. “The idea behind the street for life campaign is about inter-agency collaboration in promoting urban mobility, aimed at ensuring that drivers drive at a speed of 30km per hour within built-up areas,” he said. The FRSC boss noted that Port Harcourt harboured some very high density areas, hence the need to enlighten drivers on global best practices of driving in such sensitive areas. “This has become necessary to prevent accidents on children, older persons and persons with disabilities living in such areas,” he said. He added that the command, within available means, would mobilise its Special Marshals, the National Youth Service Corps members in the command, Road Safety Officers Wives Association and other partners for the campaign. “These partners in conjunction with officers of the command will visit all central motor garages and loading bays to sensitise drivers, who in course of their routine journey, are bound to cross several cities and towns, hence the need for adherence to this life saving advisory,” he added. Responding, Dr Lawrence Boms, Country Head and Representative of UNITAR, said the institute was very interested in promoting better driving culture through collaboration with the FRSC. “Of course, this is the sixth edition of this programme and the theme, ‘Street for Life’ is timely. We will ensure that we collaborate with Rivers Command to achieve set goals on better driving culture. “The call to reducing speed to 30km per hour in high density areas is very necessary. If Nigerians obey this advisory, a lot of road accidents will be averted,” he said. The UN country representative, however, expressed concerns over poor consequences for offenders who disobey traffic laws. He also noted the cordial relationship existing between UNITAR and the FRSC. “We’ve in the past conducted lots of training for officers in Lagos; we would, at the state level, love to collaborate with Rivers Command. “We would mop up some funds from within the UN system to support programmes of the FRSC that have direct impact on the people,” he added.
