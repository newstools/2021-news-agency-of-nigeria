By Mercy Obojeghren  Delta Government on Tuesday began training, equipping and start-up of no fewer than 100  youths in the state on shoes and leather works production.  Executive Assistant to Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa on Export Initiatives, Chief Shimite Bello said that the programme was geared toward creating employers of labour.  She spoke at the flag- off of the programme at Issele-Uku in Aniocha North Local Government Area of the state.  The first batch of trainees included persons with disabilities.  The governor’s aide, said that the participants in the first batch were made up of 40 persons drawn from the various local government areas of the state.  Bello said that the  gesture was in line with the  scaling up of the human capital development, Infrastructure development and entrepreneurship drives of the Okowa’s administration.  She said that the second and third batches of the training exercise would take place in due course.  ”Today, we are gathered here for the flag-off and Inaugural meeting of the training of more than 100 youths on leather works.  “Out of the total 100 persons we plan to train, 40 are already here for the first batch.  “This is happening today because the state governor believes strongly in human capital development as well as skill acquisition.  ”This is important to the governor  because, that way, we would be recruiting people who would in turn become employers of labour.  “Following Gov. Okowa’s ”Stronger Delta” mantra, what we are doing here today is another training program through which he wishes to achieve another landmark in his skill acquisition drive and entrepreneurship development initiatives in the state  “This, no doubt, will go a long way in beefing up his vision of industrialising the state through entrepreneurship development.  ”Those already trained would not only be able to cater for themselves and their immediate families, but would become employers of labour,” she said.  Bello advised the beneficiaries of the training programme to justify the state government’s huge Investments in the project by taking the exercise seriously.  One of the trainees who spoke on behalf of others, Miss Edith Oghenewede, expressed appreciation to the state government.  The 30-year-old graduate of Banking and Finance from Federal Polytechnic, Auchi, said that  the training would go a long way in beefing up their economic status.
