By Bosede Olufunmi  Mr Muhuyi Rimingado, the Chairman Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, says media is very critical to the successful execution of anti-graft campaign in the country.   He said this in a goodwill message to the 2021 Nigerian Guild of Editors Biennial Convention on Monday in Kano.   Rimingado was represented by the Provost of the Kano State Anti-Corruption Institute, Dr Dahiru Jafar-Usman.  He stressed the need for the anti-corruption agencies across the globe to strengthen their working relationship with the media to raise public awareness on the dangers of corruption to national development.  According to him, such relationship will also strengthen the antigraft bodies to discharge their mandate with public support and free of misperception.  “The Kano State Anti-corruption Commission is what it is today because of the collaboration and support of the media.  “The activities of the commission has been projected in positive light  by the media, perhaps because it is the first sub-national anti-corruption agency across the federation.  “Kano Anti Corruption Commission is the only anti-graft agency that has an institute to boost manpower capacity in the entire public service,” he said.   The chairman disclosed that the success story of the commission has encouraged Lagos, Jigawa and Oyo States to understudy their activities and operations for emulation.

The chairman disclosed that the success story of the commission has encouraged Lagos, Jigawa and Oyo States to understudy their activities and operations for emulation.  Rimingado therefore urged other states to create similar agencies to complement Federal Government efforts in curbing corruption in the country and secure funds for the provision of social amenities and infrastructure.    Usman noted that the media should not relent in performing  the  duties the constitution bestowed on  it as  the fourth estate of the realm  According to him, the media is serving as the voice for the voiceless and also promoting  anti-corruption activities, a fundamental role, which the less privilege need to know.

The chairman however advised the media to insulate itself from acts of corruption to enable it expose fraud and sharp practices inimical to national growth.  Usman later told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sideline of the conference that the commission was different from the federal model in terms of scope of mandate.  “The Kano State model is different from the Federal model. The Federal Government model only fight corruption, while Kano State fight corruption and also  serve as a public complaint institution.    “Kaduna, Lagos and Oyo States have emulated the good work and initiative of the Kano State Commission,” he explained.  According to him, the commission has a mandate to receive civil and criminal complaints on corruption and injustice.  He said the commission also provided support to the vulnerable and less privileged through its access to justice scheme.     “Kaduna, Lagos and Oyo States have emulated the good work and initiative of the Kano State Commission,” he explained.
