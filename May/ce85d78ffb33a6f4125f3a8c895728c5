By Edith Ike-Eboh Some Nollywood celebrities have teamed up to denounce the promotion of tobacco products in Nigerian movies targeting children. They disclosed this in a statement by Esther Aghotor, Creative Director, #SmokeFreeNollywood, a non- governmental organisation, in Abuja on Monday. The celebrities joined forces with the #SmokeFreeNollywood campaign backed by Washington DC-based campaign for Tobacco Free Kids in collaboration with public strategy firm, Gatefield, to mark the 2021 World No Tobacco Day. “37 per cent of these smokers started smoking as children due to the influence of movies that are created,” said the statement. Celebrities involved in the campaign include; Omotola Jalade Ekeinde, Dakore Egbuson-Akande, Osas Ighodaro, Anto Lecky and Meg Otanwa. Others include Michelle Dede, Kayode Kasum, Daniel Effiong, Linda Ejiofor, Kiki Omeili, and Imoh Emmanuel Chimezie, among others. The statement also quoted the World Health Organisation, as saying, that 370,000 children in Nigeria smoke daily. It noted that research showed that a significant percentage of current adult smokers were influenced by movies.
