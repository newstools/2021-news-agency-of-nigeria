By Ekemini Ladejobi Fans on social media have reacted to the video of the sensational singer, Davido, playfully spanking his daughter, Hailey, for attempting to twerk’ at her 2nd birthday party. Twerking is a sexually suggestive dance characterised by rapid, repeated hip thrusts and shaking of the buttocks especially while squatting. This type of dance came out of the bounce music scene of New Orleans in the late 1980s. Davido and his second babymama, Amanda, threw a lovely and quiet birthday party for their daughter, Hailey to mark her birthday in Atlanta, Georgia. The singer was seen in a video shared online, spanking his daughter after she jumped and twerked while her guests cheered on. Many applauded him for being a good dad  who is trying to correct his daughter.    Below are some of the reactions: @temilolasobola wrote; ‘The Yorubas will say ika o je se tie be’ @strut_those_heels wrote; ‘Lol this world.
