By Ezra Musa The Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (KADSEMA) on Friday, commenced training of 23 field officers to identify hazard points, for a comprehensive hazard profiling in the state. Abubakar Hassan, Executive Secretary of the agency, who made this known at a two-day training on hazard profiling for the state, said that the project was to review the state’s contingency plan. He said that the training was necessary for the state to understand the emerging hazards and build contingency plan around all early warning signals. “The agency has informed the Vice Chairmen of the 23 Local Government Areas of the state of the objective of the programme, as field officers would be engaging them in identifying hazard points in their LGAs”. The SEMA boss said that the field officers would be compiling data within 10 days, which will be reviewed by the agency, in collaboration with the Local Emergency Management Committee. Hassan stated that the project was in collaboration with the Nigeria Early Recovery Initiative (NERI) with full funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). He called on the field officers to be committed as the project, as it was critical to Kaduna State and Nigeria. One of the participants, Martins Danjuma, said the training was important to tackle emerging hazards. He however said that they were happy that the state is looking on how to develop responses around these emergencies. He said, “from the outlook of the training, it is going to cover the 23 LGAs, so in our estimation of what constitutes hazard in the state there will not be assumptions but reality, as the communities feel it.” Another participant, Telma Peters, commended KASEMA for the initiative saying, “I am happy that I will be able to prevent hazards from becoming disasters.” (NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
