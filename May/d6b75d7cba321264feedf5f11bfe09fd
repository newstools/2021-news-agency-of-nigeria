Kreiman said that lessons from the Holy Books during month of Ramadan often reminded people of their needs to always be kind, helpful and thoughtful, especially as the world slowly recovered and battled with COVID-19 pandemic. According to him, it is important to lend helping hands and lead by showing good example, as enshrined in the Holy Books. “We want to strengthen Israel-Nigeria relationship, not that existing one is not great, we are marking 60-years of wonderful diplomatic friendship and we have more to do together. “More chances to grow, whether it is in the field of innovation, security or even assistance to those in need and this is what we are doing here today,” he said. According to him, towards the end of this Ramadan month and at the end of COVID-19, which is a difficult time worldwide, we find opportunities to give and to donate. “This is why there is growth in the numbers of food items, when compared to the previous year. “We are joined together by organisations from Europe and of course the embassy and Chabad without which the donation would not have been possible,” he said. He said that the gesture was in furtherance of the good works by the National Mosque on support to families in need, therefore the choice of Muslim community. He noted that more would be done in terms of sustaining its ongoing programmes on innovation, establishment of e-learning centres and ecosystems, to deepen diplomatic relations between Israel and Nigeria. Receiving the food items, an Imam from Abuja National Mosque, Dr Muhammad Adam, expressed appreciation to Israel for the gesture. “On behalf of Nigerian Muslims I will like to thank Israel, especially those who are living with us here in Nigeria. “Nigeria is a friendly country and we are friends to the entire world; we receive everybody regardless of his or her belief, tradition or geographical location. “These will go a long way to providing avenues for peace and mutual understanding and to continue a peaceful approach to doing this is much better than violence,” Adam said. Meanwhile, Rabbi Israel Uzan, Rabbi of Israel to Nigeria, stressed that there was the need for people to live in accordance with the dictates of the Holy Books. He noted that by so doing children learn to imbibe importance of mutual co-existence, saying when we live in peace together, we will find solution to everything in life. “We have to educate our children to learn to imbibe mutual co-existence together; when we live in peace together, we will find a solution to everything. “It is only through peace that the world can best be developed and sustained in unity,” Uzan said.
