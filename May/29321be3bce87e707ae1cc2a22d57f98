By Mercy Obojeghren   Gov. Ifeanyi  Okowa of Delta has commended artisans in the state for contributing to the development of Nigeria.  Okowa gave the commendation at the maiden edition of Ika Artisans’co Day Celebration on Monday, at Boji Boji Owa in Ika North East Local Government Area of the state.  The governor, who was represented by the former Ika North East Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Godwin Ogadi, commended the organisers for the initiative.  He described the event as a unifying factor.  Okowa urged the various artisan associations to remain united, peaceful and law-abiding in order to attract more benefits to their members.  He thanked the association for its continuous support for his administration, especially during the just concluded local government elections in the state.  On his part, leader of  the artisans in the state, Chief Ifeanyi Abanum, commended the governor for his good works in Delta.  Abanum, however, said that it was unfortunate that artisans always came out in their large numbers to vote, but were not benefiting anything from the government in terms of empowerment.  On his part,  the Chairman of the artisans association in Ika North East, Mr Patrick Uzum, said that the association was an amalgamated union operating independently in the labour industry in Nigeria.  Uzum said that the association was formed in Ika  to bring the artisans together under one umbrella, to achieve a better goal for members and contribute to the development to Ika people.
