By Aisha Cole Sheikh Nurudeen Kadiri, the Chief Imam, Sideeqot Megida Central Mosque, Ikorodu, has urged Nigerians to extend the unity and tolerance learnt during the Ramadan period to avoid ethnic attack in the country. Kadiri made the appeal after the Eid-el-Fitri prayer in Ikorodu,  Lagos on Thursday. He advised Nigerians to always remember God (Allah) in all their decisions, which, he said, would go a long way in bringing an end to ethnic discrimination. “We should love our neighbours as we love ourselves. If we try to imbibe all the good virtues we exhibited in the Ramadan, all the ethnic attacks will stop. “If we try to imbibe the virtue of Ramadan that you see your fellow human being as your brother, I hope and pray that Nigeria will be better for it. “Those who are advancing ethnicity should fear God and they should remember that we are from the same parents, Adam and Hawa (Eve). “Remember the people of Bosnia and Rwanda; up till this present time, they are still counting their losses,” Kadiri said. According to him, Nigerian leaders should uphold the virtue of justice and when there is justice, there will be peace in Nigeria. The chief imam, however, urged Muslims to continue to carry over all the virtues learnt during Ramadan to all levels of government. A Retired Civil Servant, Alhaja Risikat Adesina in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), appreciated God for seeing her through the 30-day fasting and prayed for peace to reign in the country. Also, a Businessman, Mr Abdul-Lateef Lawal, urged the government to look into the high cost of living and to improve on security in the country. Meanwhile, a student, Aliyah Cole, advised government to look into the issue of power supply to enable students read at night.
