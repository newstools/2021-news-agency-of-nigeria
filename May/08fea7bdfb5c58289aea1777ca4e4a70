By Lizzy Okoji Kogi Gov. Yahaya Bello has lauded the Federal Government over the appointment of Dr Abdulkarim Obaje as National Coordinator of the Federal CARES Support Unit, Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus (NG-CARES).

The NG-CARES is a Federal Government, World Bank assisted initiative that is being implemented in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT. The initiative aims at mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on the rural economy using CSDP, Fadama and Bank of Industry platforms. Bello, who said that the appointment of Dr Obaje had also been endorsed by the World Bank Nigeria Office, said that it was a step in the right direction. The governor therefore urged Obaje to carry out his national assignment with due and the interest of the masses he was appointed to serve. “With Dr Obaje overseeing such a very crucial assignment which is expected to have a direct social economic impact on the well being of Nigerians across board, his long years of experience would be a veritable advantage,” he said. He, however, pointed out that the devastating effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the living standard of the citizens could not be over emphasized. “Hence, any effort made by the government at any level to mitigate such an effect and enhance economic recovery must be supported to succeed,” he said. The governor urged the National Coordinator to engage in his assignment with due diligence and the interest of the masses at heart. He also pleaded that respective stakeholders should work with him to ensure the success of the assignment. According to him, Obaje brings on board over twenty years of work experience with development partners. Until this appointment, he was the National Coordinator of the Community and Social Development Project (CSDP).
