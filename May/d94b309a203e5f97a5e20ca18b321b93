By joy Akinsanya Ogun State Government has restated its commitment to ensure food security, wealth and job creation through friendly policies and regular engagement with farmers. The state Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Adeola Odedina, said this at a food dialogue organised by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Value-chain Development Programme (VCDP), on Thursday at Kobape, Obafemi Owode Local Government Area, Ogun. Odedina said the dialogue was initiated by the United Nations, toward the New York world summit coming up in September. He said Prince Dapo Abiodun’s administration mandate centred on using agriculture to boost food security, jobs and wealth creation. Odedina said the forum would create pathways to a nutritious and healthy food system, to achieve the mandate of the United Nations, federal and state governments in rural communities. He added that the input of the grassroots farmers would go a long way in shaping national and international policies to drive efficient farming and food system at large. “The programme which took place in seven other states in the country captured the voices of rural dwellers on their plight on food production, so as to create pathways to a nutritious and healthy food system in the country. “Ogun was one of the luckiest state selected to be part of the dialogue, I believe that it will be more useful for the state to formulate policies on agriculture,” he said. The commissioner added that the outcome of the forum would be useful for Ogun state especially in formulating future policy for economic growth and development. Also speaking, the VCDP National Programme Coordinator, Mr Garba Bala, said the inputs of the participants would form the basis for short and long-term plans for hygienic processing of food. Bala was represented at the event by the curator at the event, Mr Seriki Musa. The VCDP Coordinator in the state, Mr Samuel Adeogun, said the exercise was organised ahead of the global food summit to get the thoughts of the farmers. A traditional ruler, Oba Johnson Alani, who commended the state government for the initiative, stressed the need for regular engagements to boost food production. Alani also lauded the state government for bringing stakeholders in the industry together to analyse and proffer solutions to food security in the country. One of the participants, Mr Johnson Ajibola, said the dialogue would expand the scope of strategy to be adopted in the realisation of food abundance in the state. Ajibola noted that modern way of agriculture would be enhanced with the involvement of the youth and women.
