Olajire said, on Thursday, that the Falcons will join Jamaica, Portugal and host, U.S, at the event, which will be featured at the BBVA Stadium in Houston and the brand-new $240million Q2 Stadium in Austin built by the newest club in the Major League Soccer, Austin FC”. “Both cities are in the state of Texas and the clash between the Super Falcons and the US Women team will be the first-ever football match at the state-of-the-art Q2 stadium,”Olajire said. The tournament, scheduled for June 10 to June 16, will see Falcons face Jamaica on the opening day of the event before taking on Portugal three days later at the BBVA Stadium.
