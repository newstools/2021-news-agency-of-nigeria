Audi has put more than 10,000 employees on short-time work at its Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm plants in southern Germany, as a result of a shortage of integrated circuits, or chips, the upmarket carmaker reported on Friday. Two production lines at the Ingolstadt company headquarters where the A3, A4 and A5 cars are made had already been idled, the Volkswagen subsidiary said. Lines at Neckarsulm will be halted from next week. The company was unable to say how things would proceed in June. Audi has had to idle production a number of times over recent months in response to the chip shortages that have affected most major vehicle manufacturers.(dpa/NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
