The president told her bereaved father, Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim, Sarkin Ayyukan Muri, the Emir of Muri, Alhaji Abbas Tafida and Gov. Darius Ishaku of Taraba that the nation had lost a woman leader. “We lost a great leader with an indomitable spirit with people, especially the womenfolk at her heart. The late Aisha Alhassan was strong, bold and people-oriented,” he said. He prayed to Allah to repose her soul.

He urged him to remain calm and steadfast and act decisively to deal with the enemies of the state whom he blamed for the security challenges facing the nation. Gov. Ishaku described the late Minister as one of the closest persons to him. He said: “Once she is committed to something, she remains consistent. ”She was a great mobilizer. She served well as minister and did not speak lies.” The governor expressed the appreciation of his administration to the president for the confidence he had in him. “We appreciate Mr. President.
