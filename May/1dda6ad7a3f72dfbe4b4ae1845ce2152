By Oluwaseyi Oduneye-Ogunwomoju A 13 year-old boy, Joshua Aitan, on Wednesday won the second edition of the 3D Kids Talent Hunt for Secondary Schools in Ibadan, Oyo State. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Aitan, however, got N250,000 and 50kg of Titan Farms, Nigeria made rice for six months, among other items. NAN also reports that the maiden edition of the talent hunt was won by an 11-year-old Ayomide Olubowale. Valentina Oni, 16, of Atanda Neighborhood Private Secondary School, won the second position, with N150, 000 and 25kg rice to be supplied for six months. Also, Zainab Oyetunji, 18, of Adifase High School, came third and got N50,000, among other gift items. NAN reports that the tournament was organised by the second Runner-Up of MTN Project Fame West Africa Season 5, Adetoun Oshodi. However, no fever than 100 students from 70 schools in Oyo State, took part in the competition. Elated Aitan told NAN that he was delighted to emerge winner, in spite of numbers that took part in the competition. The winner said he could only attribute his victory to God, the author and finisher of everything. “I’m so happy, because my father is a pastor, and that I came to the competition, knowing   that I will be singing only the gospel songs, and I put all my hope in God. `I’m very happy that my God didn’t disappoint me, and He crowned my efforts with success,” he said. Oshodi told NAN that her passion for children brought about the competition. “I want to help them further harness their innate abilities and limitless potential, assist them to see the amassing possibilities in music and set them on the path of tremendous success. “The competition was about the talents discovery and its nurturing to full potential. “The plans for winners are to promote them locally, and also, with the help of their parents, assist them in starting career in music, as well as showcase them in most of the local events in Ibadan city. “My take on talent shows for kids is simple: I know most parents are scared of allowing their kids to be in the limelight, because they are going to be molested. “Most parents also feel that the kids are going to be exposed to things they are not supposed to have access to, but I strongly believe that most of them need to know their talents,” she said. Oshodi then, urged parents, whose children are interested in singing, to keep encouraging and supporting them to acquiring more talents. “No talent is a waste. They should also encourage them to be focussed and not give up on their dreams. “I advise these future stars to know their strong and weak points, as these will help them to focus their strength on particular aspects of entertainment and maximise their potentials” she said. (NAN)  By Oluwaseyi Oduneye-Ogunwomoju A 13 year-old boy, Joshua Aitan, on Wednesday won the second edition of the 3D Kids Talent Hunt for Secondary Schools in Ibadan, Oyo State.
