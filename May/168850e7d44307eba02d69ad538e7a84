“Cliff Walkers,” Chinese director Zhang Yimou’s first foray into the spy genre, continued topping China’s box office chart, according to data from the China Movie Data Information Network on Sunday. The action thriller grossed nearly 44.8 million yuan (about 6.9 million U.S. dollars) on Saturday, marking the 13th consecutive day of its dominance over China’s daily box office. Set in northeast China in the 1930s, it follows Communist Party special agents as they test their wits against their enemies to complete a secret mission. It has pocketed 915 million yuan since its release on April 30. It was followed by “Break Through the Darkness,” a crime action movie telling the story of China’s fight against organized crime, which finished the day with 29 million yuan in daily revenue. The revenge thriller “Wrath of Man” took the third place with nearly 23 million yuan.(Xinhua/NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
