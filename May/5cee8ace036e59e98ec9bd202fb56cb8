Dr Ruqayya Wamakko, the Director in charge of the Primary Healthcare Unit, FPHCB, charged the media to help champion the information about the vaccine.  According to her, no intervention will work without telling people of what to do and that media can  help drive the information that will encourage people to turn out for the vaccine.  She said that COVID-19 vaccine  development was given priority because of the emergency attached to the virus in the rate which  was killing people and advised people to take the vaccination serious.  “Coronavirus vaccine is the fastest developed vaccine in the world, emergency is given to it because of the way it has been killing people.  “A lot of stages must be past before a vaccine is developed, but COVID-19 vaccine case is different,” Wamakko said.
