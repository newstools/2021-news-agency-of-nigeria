By Dorcas Jonah A Civil Society Organisation, Era for Sustainable Leadership and Accountability Initiative (NESLAI), has threatened to protest at different venues of a scheduled Permanent Secretaries computer based examination, if organisers insist on the test. The group, in a statement signed by its Executive Director, Edwin Olorunfemi, on Sunday in Abuja noted that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the process to select five new permanent secretaries to replace five other retired ones in Ekiti, Katsina, Nasarawa, Enugu and Lagos States. The Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HOCSF), Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan in a resent statement said that 47  candidates had been cleared to sit for a written examination to fill the five vacancies. The candidates were to sit for written and Information Communications Technology (ICT) examinations to select the best five that would fill the vacant posts. The CSO which commended the head of service for setting up a committee for the process of selection for the accreditation exercise, however, faulted the procedure of sitting for a written and ICT examination as prerequisite for the appointment of permanent secretaries. The group described the process of subjecting a director to ICT proficiency test in Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint Application which was expected of the support staff, as laughable. “If anything, it is making a mess of the candidates and the entire civil service. “Our stand still remain that written and ICT examination slated for May 31 and June 3, be dropped. ”It is worthy of note that, for a civil servant to rise to the level of director, he/she must have sat for about 10 examinations from Grade level 08 to Grade level 17. ”On this backdrop, we are appealing to the Federal Government to drop the idea of written and ICT examination as it is tantamount to waste of time and resources. “However, we request the government to appraise and appoint permanent secretaries on their past contributions as directors to national development. ”The written examination and ICT proficiency test of May 31 and June 3, be collapsed into oral interview and interactive session for the 47 successful accredited candidates. ”Candidates should be asked on-the-job questions and their achievement so far in their respective positions as directors. ”With this, the best three candidates from each state can be recommended to Mr President for the appointment.” Olorunfemi expressed hope that the Federal government would heed to the advice and act accordingly.
