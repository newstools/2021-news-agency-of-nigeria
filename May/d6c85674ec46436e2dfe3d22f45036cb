The 2020 CAF Super Cup scheduled for Doha in Qatar on Friday will be played in a biologically safe environment. The match in the bio-bubble will pit the 2019/2020 CAF Champions League winners, Al Ahly of Egypt, against winners of the 2019/2020 CAF Confederation Cup, Renaissance Sportive de Berkane of Morocco. It will kick off at 1900 hours Local time at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium. This means that both teams and officials who will be involved in the match will be in a “bio-bubble” upon arrival. This includes no contact with people who are outside the biologically safe environment prior to the match. This is the first time CAF adopts a full bio-bubble in a match since the start of the pandemic last year. The Qatari capital Doha hosted the two previous editions of the CAF Super Cup and will once again be the host of the annual one-match playoff. The CAF Super Cup is an annual match between the winners of the CAF Champions League and the winners of the CAF Confederation Cup. The first edition was held in 1993 between the winners of the African Cup of Champions Clubs (now known as the CAF Champions League) and the winners of the African Cup Winners’ Cup. Since 2004, it has brought together the winners of CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup.
