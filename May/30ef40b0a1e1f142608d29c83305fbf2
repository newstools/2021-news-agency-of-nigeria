By Emmanuel Mogbede The Forum of Buhari Support Groups (FOBSG) says insecurity and other challenges presently confronting the country are temporal setbacks that can be overcome with the collective efforts of all. The National Chairman of the forum, Dr Abiso Kabir, gave the assurance while commenting on the development at a news conference in Abuja on Friday. Kabir, however, alleged that some issues of insecurity in parts of the country were being perpetrated by opposition politicians. “There are indications that some of these are being contrived and fuelled by bad-belly politics and those who don’t wish the country and its people well. “We do not intend to give excuses for the unfortunate security challenges we are facing as a nation Yet, as support groups for this administration, we are of the firm conviction that these are temporary setbacks and trying periods for our nation and we shall overcome,’’ he said. Kabir, therefore, urged the media to exercise more discretion in the reportage of criminal elements that tend to enjoy and revel in the publicity they get from the media. He added that rather than the blame game, what was needed to address the situation was for all hands to be on deck, collaborating with the present administration. The chairman assured Nigerians that the Federal Government was working to ensure enduring solutions to the country`s challenges, especially security. He appealed to individuals and groups that may have genuine grievances to channel such through existing democratic institutions in the country to avoid heating up the polity. Kabir commended the armed forces and other security agencies for their loyalty and the way they discharged their duties to the country and President Muhammadu Buhari. He noted that Nigeria had come a long way since independence in 1960, grappling with the challenges of evolving as a nation of our dreams. “You will agree also that these crises didn’t start today, they have been with us right from our days as a young independent nation,’’ he said. He added that within the last sixty years, attempts had been made by governments at all levels to find lasting solutions to the country`s challenges. He noted that tremendous efforts had been made in addressing some of the challenges since the Buhari-led administration came to office in 2015. Kabir said besides ensuring infrastructural development, the administration had since its inception, opened up the political space for participation in government. This, he said, it did by appointing technocrats irrespective of political leanings with the aim of delivering democracy dividends to the people. “This Buhari-led administration, you will agree with me, has done so much in putting infrastructure in place in the transport sector and road construction. “Equally, a massive agricultural revolution is ongoing with rice and other staple foodstuffs that Nigeria has not only become self-sufficient but also exporting to our neighbouring countries for increased foreign exchange.. “When you consider the relentless fight against corruption, which was at its peak when the Buhari came on board, compared with the present situation, you cannot but give an above-average mark to this government in tackling the hydra-headed monster,’’ he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that FOBSG is an umbrella body of all Buhari Support Groups in the country.
