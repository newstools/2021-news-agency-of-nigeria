The sector commander said this in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ado-Ekiti on Tuesday. She disclosed that more than 300 regular marshals and 365 special marshals had been engaged for traffic control across the state. “As Eid-el-Fitri will be celebrated by Muslim faithful worldwide on May 12 and May 13 to mark the end of Ramadan, Muslim faithful and other Nigerians may want to use the period to celebrate with their families and loved ones, thus compelling them to travel from one point to another. “FRSC, Ekiti sector command, in collaboration with other relevant security agencies, will be carrying out special patrol operations, which will commence from May 11 to May 17,” the sector commander said. She added that the special patrol operation was aimed at ensuring that all motorists and other road users had safe and memorable celebrations, even amidst COVID-19 pandemic and security challenges. “This special patrol operation is to reduce road traffic crashes and traffic infractions. “It will ensure prompt response to road traffic crash victims and enforcement as well as strict compliance with COVID-19 protocols by motorists.   “The patrol will give robust public enlightenment and education as well as clear possible obstructions,” she said. Akinlade, however, warned that there would be strict enforcement of traffic violations, such as compliance with COVID-19 protocols, overloading, using phones while driving, using worn-out tyres and other life-threatening traffic offences.
