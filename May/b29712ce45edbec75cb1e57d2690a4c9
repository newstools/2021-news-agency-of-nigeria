The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, made the call in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday, to felicitate Nigerians on the  Eid-el-Fitr, marking the end holy month of Ramadan. Ologbondiyan said that the virtues of self-sacrifice, love, perseverance and inner peace embodied in the lessons of the holy month of Ramadan should continue to guide Nigerians to overcome the challenges of life. “As a people, we are faced by all sorts of new surge in terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, vandalism; recklessness and the menace of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Indeed, this is the time for Nigerians to keep hope alive, believing that with trust in God and unity of all, this ugly phase in the life of our nation will surely pass. “ Nigerians should also use the occasion to pray for the country and show love to one another, especially the downtrodden and the victims of the scourge of terrorism and banditry in our nation,” he said.
