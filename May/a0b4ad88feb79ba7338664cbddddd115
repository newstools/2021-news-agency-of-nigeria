French Open champion Iga Swiatek allowed Karolina Pliskova a mere 13 points in a 6-0, 6-0 humiliation for the Rome Masters title on Sunday. Swiatek, 19, dropped just four points against the ninth-ranked former US Open finalist Pliskova in a 19-minute first set. She needed only 27 additional minutes to wrap up her third career title on her first match-point. The double bagel win will move the Polish teenager into the top 10 for the first time in her career. Swiatek will be up from 15 two weeks before her title defence at the next Roland Garros grand slam. “I was very focussed today (Sunday) and I am proud of myself,” Swiatek said. “I am really happy to win this tournament in Rome.” (dpa/NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
