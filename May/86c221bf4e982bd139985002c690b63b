By David Adeoye  Gov Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has congratulated the Muslims faithful in the state and the country at large on the completion of the Ramadan fast and the celebration of Eid-el-Fitri.  Makinde in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Taiwo Adisa, on Tuesday in Ibadan, described the end of the Ramadan as a thing of joy for both Muslims and non-Muslims alike.  The governor, who used the opportunity of the Eid el Fitri to call for prayers to end insecurity in the country, enjoined Muslim faithful in the state to reflect the spiritual benefits of Ramadan.  According to Makinde, the spiritual benefits of Ramadan include love, peace and justice in their daily living and through this, contribute to the development of the nation.  He equally called on all Muslims not to depart from their good ways exhibited during the 30 days of spiritual exercise, which, he said had drawn them closer to Almighty Allah (SWT) with a lot of lessons learnt in the process.  The governor also urged all Nigerians to be law-abiding and embrace the spirit of love, self-discipline, kindness and tolerance as taught by the Holy Prophet Mohammed (SAW).  He urged residents to celebrate in moderation and show love to one another, asserting that the current situation in the country had made it imperative for Muslims and non-Muslims to live in peace and harmony.  He further urged the people to seek the face of God in prayer for divine intervention over the various challenges facing the country.
