By Jessica Onyegbula The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, has urged  chairmen and members of Governing Boards of Parastatals (CMGBP) agencies to entrench good governance in their various organisations. Mustapha made the call at the induction programme for Chairmen and Members of Governing Boards of  Parastatals by the Federal government, organised by the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR),  in Abuja. Boss, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, General Services in the Office  of the SGF, Maurice Mbaeri, stressed that members must remain worthy of the trust reposed in them by their respective appointments. He noted that some of the boards of parastatals roles and responsibilities as ensuring that the federal government of Nigeria long-term interest is served. ”Statutory board councils shall set operational and administrative policies in accordance with government policy directives and shall supervise the implementation of such policies. ”A board shall not be involved directly in the day- to- day management of a parastatals or an agency. A Minister exercises control of parastatals at policy level through the board of the parastatals only. ”No part-time member of the board shall be allowed to retain official vehicles for use on a permanent basis. The board shall promote sustainable and cost-efficient activities of the organisation,” he said. The Director-General,  Bureau of Public Service Reforms, Mr Ibrahim Arabi said that the primary objective of the induction is to enable Governing Boards Members gain understanding of their roles. Arabi added that the induction was for the board members to know how to contribute effectively to promote corporate governance practices in the Agencies. ”This will help them know their key responsibilities and the behaviour required of them in their respective organisations, both as individuals and as part of the board’s collective responsibility,” he said. Dr Vladimir Kreck, Resident Representative of Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), said that good governance translates everywhere,  were internalised and applied by government actors into respect for the rule of law,  transparency,  accountability,  equality and efficiency.(NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
