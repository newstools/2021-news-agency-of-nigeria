It was geared towards harnessing inherent economic and preservative gains in the subsector. Osibanjo noted that the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goal acknowledged that waste management must be carried out in an environmentally sound manner bearing in mind that development is not destruction. “Sadly, developmental policies and programmes running into billions of Naira are most times being executed without proper consideration for attendant ecological cost on such projects. “How much of water, air and environmental pollution resulting from a project must be adequately considered before project implementation. “This will properly assist mitigate long and short term environmental impacts. “Stakeholders/contractors in the value chain of any given developmental project must begin to pay distinct percentage for waste so that no company or government singlehandedly bears the brunt,” he said. In an online visual contribution, Mr Carlos Filho, President, International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), said that there was need for a conscious effort towards salvaging the ecosystem.
