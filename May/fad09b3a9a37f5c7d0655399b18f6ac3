By Emmanuel Afonne The Patriotic Think Tank UK (PTT UK), a coalition of Igbo intelligentsia based in the UK, has urged the Southern Governors to begin full implementation of their decisions on open grazing ban. The group made the call on Monday in a statement obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. The statement was jointly signed by Chief Nnanna Igwe, Coordinator, Patriotic Think Tank UK, and the General Secretary, Chief Michael Chukwujekwu, after an extra-ordinary general meeting in the UK. The coalition said the meeting of the Southern Nigerian Governors’ in Asaba was timely considering the insecurity, killings and destruction of lives in the South East and other parts of the country. “Furthermore, the Patriotic Think Tank UK wholesomely and overwhelmingly adopts and supports the stands and resolutions of the Southern Nigerian Governors’ Forum as evidenced in their communique of May 11. “Progressively, the PTT UK, aligns with and affirms her total solidarity with all the outcome of that historic meeting known as Asaba Declaration of 2021. “The PTT UK condemns in the strongest terms, the wanton and rampant killings of Ndi Igbo in Nigeria; we consider it pathetic and reprehensible, the ongoing killings and abductions in the South East and other parts of the country under different slogans and flimsy guises. “The state of insecurity in the South East has exceeded alarming dimensions. The Nigerian military deployment and none-maintenance of peace and order by the police in the South East, South South of Nigeria is unacceptable and must stop forthwith. “The Federal Government of Nigeria recently called for de-escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian war; in the same vein, we earnestly urge President Buhari to ensure immediate de-escalation of tensions in South East and South South regions. “We also call on the UN, USA, UK, EU, China, Russia, Canada and AU to diplomatically step into the matter,” the statement said. The group also commended the Southern Governors Forum for inaugurating the Ebubeagu Security outfit. They, however, called for full scale rollout of the security outfits across the entire South East as a matter of urgency. “We call on all vigilante groups, community security networks and formations in the South East and South South to work together to ensure peace and security. “Ebubeagu should be effectively equipped with modern sophisticated hardware and full in-depth training to protect lives and properties in the South East. “We condemn the activities of illegal carriers of AK-47 and killers in our forests, the activities of unknown gunmen, the burning of police stations and operational vehicles, banditry, kidnappings, rape and destruction of farms across the country. “These vices threaten the unity and future of Nigeria. Every effort must be made to save Nigeria now. “The PTT UK calls on Ndi Igbo Worldwide including those in the Diaspora to work together to develop Alaigbo,” the statement said. The group further urged the National Assembly to ensure comprehensive amendment of the 1999 constitution and remove all obnoxious and antidemocratic content to reflect the genuine wishes of Nigerians. They also called for reflection of federal character in various federal appointments, while calling for the adoption and implementation of the outcome of the 2014 constitutional conference.
