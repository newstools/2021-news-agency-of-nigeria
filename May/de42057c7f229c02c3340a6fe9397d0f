Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday urged the international community to stop Israel from attacking the Palestinians. Saeed Khatibzadeh, the spokesman of the ministry, said that all the responsible organizations, including Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations Security Council, should act effectively to prevent further Israeli aggression and take actions to secure the rights of the Palestinians. “Iran’s plan to resolve the Palestinian issue is holding a referendum with the participation of all the main inhabitants of the Palestinian lands, including Muslims, Jews and Christians. “We have always stood by the oppressed people of Palestine,” Khatibzadeh made the remarks during his weekly press conference.
