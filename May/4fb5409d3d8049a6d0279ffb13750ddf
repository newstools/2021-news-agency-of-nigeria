Ganduje said that the gesture was to complement the Federal Government’s efforts to further reduce congestion in the nation’s prisons. He advised the ex-inmates to change their attitudes to life and pray for peace and stability in Nigeria. The governor also gave each of the freed inmates N5,000 as transport fare to their various destination.
