By Oladapo Udom The Flag Officer Commanding (FOC), Western Naval Command, Rear Admiral Jason Gbassa, on Monday said that reliable hydrographic data and information from the Nigerian Navy (NN) would further guide maritime activities. Gbassa made the assertion at a reception of Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) LANA, which held at NNS BEECROFT Jetty/Parade Ground, Apapa, Lagos. He said that the Hydrographic ship, NNS LANA, would help provide the data and information needed to help make the sea more better and safe place for maritime activities. “NN’s capacity to conduct hydrographic survey that will assure safety of naval and merchant traffic over the sea is significantly impaired with the absence of a hydrographic ship in NN fleet. “With NNS LANA joining the fleet, the maritime industry can be assured of getting improved and reliable hydrographic data and information from the NN to guide maritime activities,’’ he said. According to the FOC, in seafaring, safety is key and can mean life. All the potentials and prospects man stands to benefit from the sea and by traversing it amounts to nothing without safety. “Anything that will keep one away from danger in an unfriendly environment such as the sea is welcome. “Therefore, NNS LANA is one such asset hence our joy at receiving the ship,’’ Gbassa said. He said that the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo’s leadership reflected in his vision to re-energise the NN and motivate its personnel. “Indeed, the Command is grateful for this rare privilege to receive the brand new NNS LANA. “I have no doubt that the ship will contribute to safety in the maritime industry as well as to Nigeria’s national security,’’ Gbassa said. Also speaking, the Commanding Officer (CO), NNS LANA, Captain Abdullateef Mahmud said that the ship spent 30 days at sea from France on her voyage to Lagos, Nigeria. “Based on the average speed of 10 knots, the ship covered a total distance of 4,005 nautical miles and approximately spent 30 days on the voyage. “The ship stopped over at four countries which were Portugal, Spain, Gambia and Ghana. “The ship performed satisfactorily well during the voyage except for one oil operation unit that developed a problem which was rectified in Portugal,’’ Mahmud said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the construction of NNS LANA commenced in France in Dec. 2018 and was completed in July 2020. The ship was launched on September 2020 in France and was handed over to the Nigerian Navy on Jan. 15, 2021.
