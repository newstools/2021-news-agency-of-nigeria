Iraq’s Ain al-Asad air base, which hosts U.S. and other international forces, was attacked with a rocket on Monday. U.S. Army Colonel Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the U.S.-led international military coalition, however said no one was killed in the attack. He tweeted that initial reports suggested the attack took place at 1:35 p.m. (1035 GMT) and added that the damage was being assessed. The United States accuses Iranian-backed militia groups of launching regular rocket attacks against its troops in Iraq. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday’s attack.
