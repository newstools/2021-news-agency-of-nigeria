By Ifeanyi Nwoko Former Minister of Special Duties Tanimu Turaki has urged Muslims across Nigeria not to depart from the values of benevolence, unity and peace which guided them during the Ramadan. Turaki said in an Eid-el-fitr message to Muslims, issued in Abuja on Thursday, that they should be steadfast in upholding the values. He explained that such principles as advanced during Ramadan should be the core of every Muslim. The former minister said that it was expected of every Muslim to continually abide by the principles of neighbourly love, benevolence and peace. “Today, the Muslim Ummah across Nigeria and the world celebrate the end of the month-long Ramadan fast in accordance with the Holy Qu’Ran. “Throughout this past month, we have prayed for ourselves, our families, our communities and the nation at large and it is my fervent hope and prayer that Almighty Allah will answer these prayers. “As we move forward, we must continue to embody the principles that we have practiced throughout this month. “We must love our neighbours as ourselves; we must endeavour to continue to give to those in need; and we must continue to work to foster the peace and unity of Nigeria. “It is my prayer that our prayers will lead to sustained peace. “It is also my hope that the states across the nation that have been bedevilled by violence will become safer and more secure,” he said. He prayed that Almighty Allah in his infinite wisdom and grace will continue to bless, guide and protect Nigeria.
