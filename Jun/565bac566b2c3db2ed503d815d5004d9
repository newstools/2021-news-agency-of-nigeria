By Ramatu Garba The Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has restated its commitment to metering in line with the Federal Government’s initiative in the country. The Head of Corporate Communications KEDCO, Ibrahim Sani-Shawai, who stated this in a statement issued to newsmen in Kano, on Monday, also warned consumers against what he called ‘meter apathy’. “We are committed to ensuring end of estimated billing system in the Kano franchise and we will roll out more phases of metering going forward, to complement the present phase.” The statement said thousands of households had been metered and the scheme was still ongoing so as to plug the outstanding gaps. “Our metering has remained free and we still insist it is free, hence, any act towards sabotaging our efforts of free metering whether by staff or non staff, would not be tolerated and would be prosecuted. “KEDCO also warns against meter apathy from customers because we have observed that some customers deliberately refuse metering. This is unacceptable to us, as it is the way forward for the Kano franchise,” the statement said. Sani-Shawai called on the general public to report any case of extortion before, during or after metering to the nearest KEDCO office, while urging customers to embrace metering.
