By Vivian Emoni The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the revised National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and National Climate Change Programmes for the country. A statement by Mr Saghir el Mohammed, Director of Press in the Ministry of Environment, said that the approval was given at the FEC meeting, on Wednesday, in Abuja. Speaking on the development, the Minister of Environment, Dr Muhammad Abubakar, explained that the new Policy document captured updates of emerging issues in the sector that were not captured in the previous policy. These, according to him, included the inclusion of the Paris Agreement, signed by Mr President in 2015, and Gender mainstreaming, which was very relevant to the national response to climate change. “The new National Policy on Climate Change, with its programmatic plan of action, is expected to run through 2021-2030. “The objective of the new policy is to implement mitigation measures and promote low-carbon, high-growth economic development. “It will also strengthen adaptation towards a sustainable climate resilient development pathway. “The National Climate Change programmes document complements the National Policy by identifying measures and actions. “The measures and actions will be implemented in a programmatic manner to address most, if not all, of the challenges posed by climate change and climate vulnerability in the country,” the minister said. The Minister thanked the President for approving the policy document and for his unparalleled commitment to climate change issues and concerns that earned him global recognition.
