By Stanley Nwanosike The Progressive Students Movement (PSM), an NGO, has hailed the Senate for passing a bill seeking to end discrimination between HND and BSc holders in the country. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Senate, on Wednesday, read for the third time and passed the bill. The bill seeks to end discrimination between first degrees graduates from universities and Higher National Diploma (HND) holders from polytechnics in the country both on cadre and point of entry to all private and government establishments. The President of PSM, Mr Bestman Okereafor, told NAN on Wednesday in Enugu that the bill was “a welcome development’’. According to Okereafor, it is a step in the right direction that will help strengthen the polytechnic system and end rush for theoretical-based education. “PSM strongly believes the said bill will greatly serve as motivation and morale booster for polytechnic graduates across the federation. “We heartily congratulate all polytechnic students and graduates in Nigeria,’’ he said. On proposed scrapping of the National Youth Service Scheme, the boss of PSM, which is a pan-Africa students’ movement, however, advised the Federal Government not to consider the proposal. “NYSC remains a major bridge builder, which enhances and upholds national unity aimed at further developing our beloved country with well trained academic manpower,’’ he said.
