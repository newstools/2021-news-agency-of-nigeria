By Ismail Abdulaziz Africa’s leading sugar manufacturer, the Dangote Sugar Refinery (DSR) has unveiled an innovative sugar brand, tagged: New Look, Same Great Quality. The ceremony for the unveiling of the white granulated white sugar was conducted on Thursday at the ongoing Kaduna 42nd International Trade Fair. The vitamin A fortified sugar excited participants who thronged the Dangote Special Day to make enquiries. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony, Representative of the DSR, Bello Sadik, described the DSR as the market leader, saying the repackaged product is part of the effort at giving the consumer a superior quality. Acting President of the Kaduna Chamber of Commerce Industry Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA), Alhaji Suleiman Aliyu, said Dangote Group has ‘broken record’ in all its investments and undertakings. He congratulated the President of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, for the repackaged sugar product, and several other innovations. “Dangote has come to rescue Nigeria to make it self-sufficient in food and other products,” he said. Other products that were exhibited at the Dangote Special Day include: Dangote Cement, Dangote Salt and Dangote Fertilizer. In his speech, representative of the Dangote Group at the event, Mr Hashem Ahmed, said the company had keyed into the Federal Government Backward Integration Policy to make Nigeria self-sufficient in the sugar subsector. Hashem said that Dangote was passionate about growing Nigeria’s economy, which informed his current massive investment in sugar and partnership with KADCCIMA and the Kaduna State Government. He said that the company was currently working on its integrated sugar complexes in Adamawa, Nasarawa and Taraba states, adding that when completed they would have significant impacts on growing the economy. He said the theme for this year’s Trade Fair, Promoting domestic production to mitigate the current economic challenges, is apt given the COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the world leading to border closures. He said the conglomerate would not rest on its oars until Nigeria, and indeed Africa settle in an enviable position among nations.(NAN) PR: Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
