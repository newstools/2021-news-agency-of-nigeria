Sulaiman-Ibrahim, speaking while being received by management and other staff of the commission in Abuja, promised to compliment all efforts that had been put in place to move the commission forward. The Federal Commissioner also pledged to work as a team and family to achieve the goals of the commission. “I will work in peace and harmony, equity and justice to achieve our mandate as a team and as individuals. “My expectation is to compliment the efforts of those I met on the ground to ensure we strengthen our effort as commission, on behalf of the country. “Expect equity and fairness from me, we will work with stability and we will double up effort,” she said. Princess Gloria Akobundu, National Coordinator, New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), who was at the event, described Sulaiman-Ibrahim as a good team player. Akobundu called on the management and staff of the organisation to play their role to make her stay successful. She also described the refugees’ commission as a friendship organisation, adding that her experience with it had been pleasant. “Everybody must play their role, refugees’ commission is a strategic department, challenges must be identified promptly for us to solve, the Federal Commissioner’s stay will be a comfort for all of us,’’ she said.
