Southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region has continued to be one of the best places in the world in terms of environment, maintaining a stable environmental quality in 2020. This is according to a report released on Thursday. The water quality of major rivers and lakes remained good while the air quality of the region continued to be excellent in 2020, noted the report compiled by the region’s ecology and environment department. By the end of 2020, Tibet had built 47 nature reserves measuring a total area of 412,200 square km, which accounts for more than one-third of the region’s total.
