By Lizzy Okoji Member Countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have said sensitisation of citizens of Member States on ECOWAS Protocol was critical to foster regional integration. Some ECOWAS Member States made the call while presenting their “Country Report” at the ongoing 2021 Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Parliament on Monday in Abuja. Members of Parliaments from The Gambia noted that without proper sensitization of ECOWAS Citizens, the implementation of various protocols and conventions will be very difficult. Presenting the report of The Gambia, Hon. Kebba Barrow, leader of the delegation noted that parliamentarians in the Gambia have continue to educate their citizens on ECOWAS integration protocols among others. “The Gambian delegation in consultation with the Ministry of Trade and ECOWAS Matters continue to publish series of newspaper press releases and advertisements on the community text. “To educate and enlighten the general populace on these important ECOWAS Community instruments,” he said. According to him, all these efforts are meant to sensitize and bring ECOWAS protocol and its institutions to the people. “We firmly believe that without proper sensitization of our citizens, the implementation of various ECOWAS protocols and conventions will be very difficult. “The delegation, on behalf of the people of the Republic of Gambia wishes to reiterate that the Gambia is ever committed to the ideals of the Regional Bloc. “And shall never relent in its efforts for the integration process of the ECOWAS Community,” Barrow noted. Similarly, Members of Parliament representation from Senegal said plans were underway by the legislators to foster regional integration by bringing border communities together. Head of the Senegalese delegation, Hon. Aime Assine, while delivering the Country Report of Senegal said such actions should also be replicated by other countries. “As part of our sensitisation activities, the ECOWAS MPs from Senegal are planning to step up activities to bring border communities closer together. “Activities that should be replicated, particularly in the areas of sport as well as culture. “The Senegalese party recommends the organising of sub-regional festivals to enhance the rich cultural heritage of our people,” Assine noted. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that regional integration is one of the core pillars of ECOWAS.
