By Ibrahim Kado The People of Mubi, Northern Adamawa  district, and Chamba Cultural Development Association (CCDA) have  demanded for the creation of Amana and Gongola States, out of Adamawa. The groups made the demand at the North East Zonal public hearing for the review of 1999 Constitution before the House of Representatives Committee in Yola on Wednesday. Mr Ahmad Sajo, Spokesperson of Mubi Local Government Area,  said that Mubi deserved to be a state, named Amana with capital city in Mubi. According to him, originally they are  part of Cameroun, but by choice,  they joined Nigeria because of promises made to them  by the then Prime Minister of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, for peace and progress. “Hence we anchor our demand on the premise of the trust we had in Nigeria which in Hausa means Amana. “Restore our status as an autonomous region or state as it was when we joined you. “This is because the premier of Northern Nigeria  promised us our continued status as a distinct entity within the Nigerian state and our capital which is Mubi,” he said. Similarly in his submission, Alhaji Yunusa Gisilanbe, State Chairman of CCDA, also demanded creation of Gongola State. He said the new state would  constitute southern senatorial district of Adamawa made up  of Ganye, Toungo, Jada, Mayo-Belwa, Demsa, Numan, Lamurde, Guyuk and Shelleng Local Government Areas. He said that if created,  three additional local government areas  needed  to be created- Gangdu from Ganye, Yelli from Jada, Nasarawo-Jereng from Mayo-Belwa, Barrong from Demsa. He further said that the association also supported local government autonomy in all ramifications. In his remarks, Rep. Mohammed Monguno, Chairman, House of Representatives  Constitutional  Review Committee,  Yola Centre, assured that all  memoranda  would be submitted before the house for considerations. Mohammed, who is the Chief Whip of  the House of Representatives, said that the review of the constitution would be based on wishes and aspirations of the people.
