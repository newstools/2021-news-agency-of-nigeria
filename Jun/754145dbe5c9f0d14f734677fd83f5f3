S/East By Ifeanyi Nwoko A South East group, Ndigbo Youth Parliament, has condemned the spate of insecurity, killing of innocent citizens as well as attacks of government infrastructure in the South East. A statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday by Mr Rikki Nwajiofor, Speaker of the group, also condemned the gruesome killing of a former Presidential Aide, Ahmed Gulak, by yet to be identified gunmen. With particular reference to Imo state, the group expressed sadness and called on all in the region to embrace peace. “Ndigbo Youth Parliament has continued to sue for peace across the nation, especially in the Southeast. “We highly condemn the gruesome murder of Ahmed Gulak in Owerri. In the same vein, we extremely frown at the murder of innocent citizens, who met their untimely death in the hands of unknown gunmen, as they went about their daily hustles. “The grisly killing of security personnel, who were exterminated while serving our beloved Nation, is quite heinous and atrocious. “These are atrocities that should be condemned by every patriotic well-meaning Igbo person,” the group said. The NYP stressed that the menaces of unknown gunmen were gradually turning the Southeast to a war zone, especially Imo state where people now live in fear. “We cannot afford to watch our enamoured Southeast, traditionally known for peace and tranquility, turned to a crisis-ridden zone. “We, therefore, call on all the security agencies, all patriotic Igbo personalities and all well-meaning Nigerians to join hands with Ndigbo Youth Parliament as we organize the “Ndigbo Youth Security Summit”. “The summit is geared towards finding lasting solutions to the insecurity that has bedeviled our cherished Southeast. “Our Youths need to be called to a roundtable for heart-to-heart discussions; a roundtable where grievances will be placated and solutions for peace proffered. “We believe that Ndigbo Youth are lovers of peace and, if given sufficient sense of belonging, will collaborate with security agencies in fishing out the enemies of our land,” the group said. It called on the people of Southeast, especially the Youths, to remain law abiding and avoid associating with any unlawful group.(NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
