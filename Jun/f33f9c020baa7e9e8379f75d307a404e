By Kingsley Okoye The Senate has passed the bill establishing the National Institute for Border Studies, Imeko in Ogun. This followed the adoption of the report of the Senate Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND at plenary on Wednesday. Presenting the report, a member of the Committee, Sen. Ayo Akinyelure (PDP- Ondo),said the institution would produce graduates with practical and theoretical knowledge in border management to reduce risks and challenges of existential threats facing the country. “Establishing the institute will reduce the ills around national borders and de-escalating chances of entrenching heinous criminal activities being perpetrated by men of the underworld,” he said. The Senate also passed the Orthopedic Hospital Management Board Act 2004 amendment bill. This followed the adoption of the report of the Senate Committee on Health (Secondary and Tertiary). Presenting the report, Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (APC- Kwara ) said the country was plagued with poverty and high rate of diseases. He said Orthopedics such as musculoskeletal disorders, spine disease, cancers, tumours and congenital defects were afflicting many Nigerians without adequate care. “Orthopedics is a specialised area of medicine concerned with the musculoskeletal system responsible for many important functions including joint replacements, fractures, joint pains, sports injuries, arthritis and other injuries and conditions,” Oloriegbe said. He said that locating the Federal Orthopedic Hospital in Kuta, Niger, would ensure that healthcare got closer to residents of densely populated urban and rural communities at reduced costs. “The hospital will provide services like diagnosis and treatment from traumatic events such as accidental falls, car accidents, sports injuries and other emergencies.
