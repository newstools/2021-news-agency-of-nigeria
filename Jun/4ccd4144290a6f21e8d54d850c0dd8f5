By Felicia Imohimi  In commemoration of the World Milk Day, the Nigerian Veterinary Medical Association (NVMA) has called for the genetic improvement of indigenous cows to increase milk production. The association made the call in a statement signed by it spokesperson, Dr Gloria Daminabo, and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday, in Abuja. NAN reports that World Milk Day is commemorated annually on June 1 and the theme for 2021 is: ‘Sustainability in the Dairy Sector along with empowering the environment, nutrition and socio-economic growth.” It noted that Nigeria had the required resources, a large cattle population, large market for dairy products, farmers, adequate veterinarians and other experts, to improve the sector. The association,  however, decried the challenges faced by the dairy sector in the country ranging from poor production practices, low milk producing indigenous breeds and inadequate policies, accounting for the sector’s underdevelopment. “It is important that these key production challenges be addressed to increase domestic milk production in sustainable ways. “There is also a critical need to engage veterinarians and other experts to successfully achieve this. “We need to do more in a partnership between the Federal, State governments and other value chain stakeholders to rapidly improve the dairy sector”, the association said. It assured of its continuous advocacy, professional roles and collaboration with all relevant stakeholders to promote sustainability in the sector, so as to combat food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty. NAN reports that since 2000, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) set aside June 1 as an annual World Milk Day, to celebrate the dairy sector and highlight the importance of milk products as a global food. The main objective of the day was to make people aware of the importance of milk and dairy products in their lives.(NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
