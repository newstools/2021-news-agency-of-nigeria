According to Billboard, its 2021 International Power Players list aims to recognise “industry leaders — nominated by their companies and peers and selected by our editors — with primary responsibility outside the United States. “Honourees include label executives, music publishers, independent entrepreneurs, artist managers and concert promoters.” Also on the list is another Nigerian Obi Asika, co-head of U.K. office, UTA. Describing Bose, Billboard wrote: “Amid the pandemic, Ogulu co-executive-produced, released and promoted the “Twice As Tall” album from Nigeria’s breakout global star Burna Boy (aka Damini Ogulu). He is signed to Bad Habit/Atlantic in the United States and Warner Music International for territories outside of Africa. Twice As Tall won best global music album at this year’s Grammy Awards. Bose has set up a publishing company through Spaceship Collective to enable Africans to own their own catalogues “so that the authenticity of our stories, our glory, our culture is sustained,” she says, “and we are empowered.” In her response to the recognition on her social media platform, Bose said, “Honored to have made it to Billboard’s 2021 international power player list. Looking forward to breaking down more doors.” Billboard is an American magazine and website that produces news, video, opinion, reviews, events, and style related to the music industry.
