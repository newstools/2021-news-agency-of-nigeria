By Naomi Sharang The Senate on Wednesday directed its Committee on Works to liaise with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to include further funding for the rehabilitation of the Ikorodu-Shagamu road in the 2022 Appropriation Bill. The upper chamber also directed the Committee and the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to provide appropriate funding for the reconstruction of the Ikorodu-Itoikin-Epe road in the 2022 Appropriation bill. The resolutions of the Senate followed a motion sponsored by Sen. Tokunbo Abiru (APC-Lagos) during plenary. The motion is titled: “Urgent need for the rehabilitation of the Ikorodu-Shagamu and Ikorodu-Itoikin-Epe road to further bridge the infrastructure gap and enhance economic growth in Nigeria.” The motion was co-sponsored by Senators Oluremi Tinubu (APC-Lagos), Adamu Aliero (APC-Kebbi), Solomon Adeola (APC-Lagos), Ibikunle Amosun (APC-Ogun), Tolulope Odebiyi (APC-Ogun) and Olalekan Mustapha (APC-Ogun). Abiru while moving the motion said that roads indirectly contributed to the economic growth of a nation. “Road development brings social, cultural and economic changes in the lives of the people in terms of providing connectivity between people and places and thus help in reducing poverty “Many roads are in bad shape; leading to negative economic effects. “The total economic effects of such bad roads to the nation, the health of the citizens, operation of businesses, safety of lives and properties are unquantifiable,’’ he said. Abiru said that the rehabilitation of Ikorodu-Shagamu and Ikorodu-Itoikin-Epe roads would facilitate easy transfer of goods and services between the interconnecting towns and adjacent states, maintaining and increasing the economic activities along the project corridor. The senators in their contributions supported the motion.
