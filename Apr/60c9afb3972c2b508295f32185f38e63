By Suleiman Shehu The Founder of One Love Family, Sat Guru Maharaj Ji, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to take steps that will ensure speedy completion of pending corruption cases against some public officers in Nigeria.   Maharaj Ji gave the advice at a news conference marking the 34th anniversary of the establishment of Mahara Ji Village, on Saturday in Ibadan.   He urged the president to order the EFCC Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, to ensure that all pending corruption cases against the public officers were vigorously pursued to logical conclusion before digging up new cases.   The religious leader said that it was a big slap on Nigeria’s moral fabrics to see some corrupt public officers roaming the streets and flaunting their ill-gotten wealth after leaving public offices.   He said that the president, being an anti-corruption ambassador in Africa, should act fast to ensure that corrupt public officers were dealt with to serve as deterrent to others.   Mahaj Ji said that doing so would save the image of the country and help recover looted funds.   He further said that adequate security must be provided in offices where Nigeria’s sensitive documents were being kept to prevent them being tampered with by enemies of the country.   According to him, some people are not happy with the achievements so far recorded by the Buhari-led administration and may be attempting to cause trouble for the government through destruction of sensitive documents.   Maharaj Ji called on those standing against the progress of the country to give way and allow Nigeria to work.   He also expressed support for the ongoing agitation for the autonomy of the judiciary in the country, saying that it was sacrosanct.   Maharaj Ji said that a situation whereby the judiciary, as an arm of government, was subjected to the whims and caprices of the executive arm was not acceptable. “The 1999 Constitution (as amended) has made provision for power sharing among the three arms of government.   “This is to check abuse within the system, such that each of the three arms of government will be financially independent,” he said.
