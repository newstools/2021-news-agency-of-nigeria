By  Jessica Onyegbula The Catholic Church on Monday urged youths to use the social media  for positive development of the country so as to  ensure  the unity and peaceful coexistence of her citizens. Rev.  Fr Mike Umoh, the National Director of Social Communications at the  CathoIic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN),  said this  in a presentation in  Abuja, during   a  3-day workshop on “Improving Communication Strategies in the Catholic Media in Nigeria”.  Umoh  spoke on the sub- theme:  ‘ Overcoming  the challenges of Social Media use in the mission of the Church in Nigeria”. The cleric  cautioned youths against the circulation of destructive audio and video messages which he said  could further create tension and violence in the country. He urged religious leaders to take advantage of the social media to evangelise and share useful contents to educate social media users.  ”Social media is where the people are and for leaders to reach out  to youths of today,  they must go through the social media. ” The social media can be used for greater good if we create a positive alternative to it,” he said.  Also, Dr Cletus Akwaya,  the Editor-in-Chief of  Daily Asset Newspaper, charged  Catholic newspapers, to brace up to the challenges  facing the industry. He said if not, they would be inadvertently towing the path of obliteration in his paper with the title: ‘Problems and prospects of successful Church newspaper in Nigeria.  Akwaya said that the  Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria should coordinate the setting up of a  Foundation for the Catholic Media services in Nigeria.  ”The  Foundation should serve as a funding platform for the Catholic Television, irs numerous diocesan newspapers, radio stations and the New Media. “Apart from mobilising funds from both local and foreign sources, the foundation will be expected to  coordinate training of journalists and media workers and help in coordinating research activities,” he said.  Mr Patrick Osu, the National President, Catholic Media Practitioners Association of Nigeria (CAMPAN), in his address of welcome,  defined  communication as a very vital instrument of life that promotes peace, love and  reconciliation.  Osu said that media practitioners should always report the truth always. ”For us as a professional body, we will not rest on our oars by promoting professionalism among our members and put into practice the teachings and doctrines of the church that will bring about sanity and compassion for human dignity.  ”We must be prepared and willing to make sacrifices to achieve our aims and objectives of uniting the body of Christ through our professional callings as social communicators.”  Osu said that the media has  the power to make this nation great  through the  various networks of the practitiobers. ”We must use our positions well within the context of professional ethics to avert dangerous trends by exposing evil and always reporting the truth. ” I believe this is the time to come together and let the society feel our impact,” he said.
