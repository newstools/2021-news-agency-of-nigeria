By Segun Giwa Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has described the Ondo Internal Revenue Service (ODIRS) as one of the key achievements his administration will always be proud of. Akeredolu said this on Tuesday in Akure at the ODIRS Soft Skill Training Programme. The Governor noted that his administration had improved tremendously on the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the State. He disclosed that the state IGR had increased from N700 million generated monthly before the advent of the administration to over N2 billion. Akeredolu emphasised the importance of training officers of the revenue service, noting that it would help them to build confidence and hunger for more achievements. “The ODIRS is one of the key areas where our government can beat its chest and come out and say we have done something great. “As I expect all of you to know, when we came in, the revenue generation was at best N700 million per month. “And from the figures that we saw just now, from 2018, 2019 and 2020, clearly we are averaging about N2 billion per month. That is three times what we met on ground,” Akeredolu said. The governor who commended the Chairman of the State Internal Revenue Service, Mr Tolu Adegbie, said that his appointment as head of the revenue service was not a mistake. “Let me say this, Tolu Adegbie, you have done wonderfully well. We have not made any mistake by requesting for your secondment from your office of comfort at WEMA Bank to come and assist us here in Ondo state. “We are proud of you. We note your efforts particularly. We couldn’t have achieved anything without this set of young men and women who are working with you. We thank you all,” Akeredolu said. The governor charged the officers to see the training as an opportunity to improve themselves and in turn, improve the revenue generation in the state. (NAN)  By Segun Giwa Gov.
