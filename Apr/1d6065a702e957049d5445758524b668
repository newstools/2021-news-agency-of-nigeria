By Mohammed Tijjani  The Nigerian Army Officers Wives Association (NAOWA), on Thursday donated some essential items to wounded soldiers receiving treatment at the 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital, Kaduna.  The Kaduna chapter Chairperson of NAOWA, Hajiya Maimunat Ali-keffi, said the choice of the hospital as her first place for the outreach was because she knew the pains of war.  “Not because I fought any war myself, but because I am a soldier’s wife whose husband has fought wars within and outside the country, and no matter how many times he falls or got injured, he never gave up”, she said.  She encouraged the soldiers not to feel that their pain was in vain, but rather regard it as a demonstration of their bravery.  “Being sick can be frustrating and tiring, but I urge you all to find strength in the families and friends around you, take their love and use it to heal as each day passes, you are one step closer to  complete recovery”, she said.  The chairperson thanked the soldiers for their sacrifice, courage, strength and most importantly putting their lives on the line in protecting Nigeria.  “We are truly indebted to you; grief is not easy, it is hard to find the right words to say to a woman that has lost her husband either yesterday, today or years ago”.  Ali-keffi condoled all the wives of soldiers who lost their husbands, saying “do not blame yourselves rather see your struggles and suffering as reasons and lessons”.  She also urged them not to give up on life, and prayed to God for the souls of the deceased to continue to rest in peace.  Alli-keffi disclosed that NAOWA in Kaduna had established a vocational training institute in Delat Barracks, which was open to widows and their families to acquire vocational skills to support their families.  “Our vocational training institute is one of its kind in  the whole of NAOWA vocational centers.  “It empowered and produced quality skills and knowledge to soldiers, their families and the civilians populace within and outside our immediate environs.”  She disclosed that the institution was affiliated to Nuhu Bamali Polytechnic Zaria and offers Diploma courses, adding that forms were already on sale.  The Chairperson appreciated the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru for his unflinching support to the 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital.  She also appreciated the Chief Medical Director for his services and support  to the sick and wounded officers and soldiers.  Responding, the Chief Medical Director, Col. Augustine Omogbethai, thanked NAOWA for the gesture and kindness to the wounded soldiers.  He commended their efforts and urged them to continue the good work, noting that it helps to make the patients better and recuperate faster.
