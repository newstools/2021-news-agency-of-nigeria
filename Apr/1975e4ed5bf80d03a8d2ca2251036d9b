By Emmanuella Anokam The Institute of Sales and Marketing Management of Nigeria (ISMMN) on Thursday inducted not less than 30 members in pursuit of professionalism and economic development. The institute was established by the Act of Parliament in 2007 and had been active in its advisory role to government in policy formulation on trade matters. Alhaji Awulu Mutkari, President-In-Council, ISMMN at the induction in Abuja, said its unique training was aimed at exposing students to rigorous educational and industrial on-field opportunities. Mutkari explained that it was engaged in training students to earn professional certification in sales and marketing management with global recognition, especially in UK, Europe, U. S. and Asia where similar institutes existed. He noted that the institute was open to all above 18 years old who wanted to pursue a career path in the noble profession. “We are in collaboration with Yaba College of Technology and soon to conclude arrangements with Federal University, Lokoja for our Diploma students,” he said Dr Johnson Anene, Vice President, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) commended the institute for creating a result oriented integrated sales and marketing management profession with international accreditation, certification and global acceptance. In a keynote address, Anene said its effort was evident in the institute’s continuance to creatively and technologically develop Nigerian graduates and other interested persons by educating, training and retraining them to meet modern day business challenges. Considering the dynamic economy of Nigeria as well as the global economy, he underscored the need for matching sales and marketing management techniques to achieve consistently visible growth. He said that ACCI would  not mind partnering with the institute in promoting business development to enhance reduced cost of doing business. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the induction which has the  theme: “Rewarding High Impact Entrepreneurs” also features an award of some entrepreneurs as economic catalysts and players in the real estate in FCT. The real estate organisations awarded included Urban Shelters, BILAAD Reality, Kingfem and EFAB Properties Ltd. among others. Chief Olu Fashina, Director-General of the institute noted that the awardees’ selection was based on the research it carried out which projected real estate as one of the sectors which was afloat in business during the  COVID-19 shutdown. Speaking with NAN, he said that the awardees applied modern technology, skilled labour and top quality management to achieve the level of excellence. Mr Maximus Nwoye, one of the inductees in an interview with NAN expressed delight for having the opportunity to be inducted as a Fellow of the institute after a thorough training. “It has been a long journey and I am happy belonging to the institute,  which is an international affiliate and a professional body. “As a member of the institute, it will help one to get to meet and relate well.
