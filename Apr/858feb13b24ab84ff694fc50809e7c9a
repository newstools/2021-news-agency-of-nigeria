By Emmanuel Afonne Pillar of Sports in Africa and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Kalu, has congratulated Nigerians on the victory of Enyimba International Football Club FC of Aba against Orlando Pirates of South Africa in a CAF Confederation Cup match. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Enyimba pipped Pirates by a lone goal in the final Group A game on Wednesday night to book their place in the quarter-finals of the CAF Confederation Cup tie in Aba. Cyril Olisema netted the only goal of the match in the 95th minute to ensure the People’s Elephant upstaged the South African side to top the group in spite of finishing on the same 9 points with Pirates. Enyimba had lost 1-2 to Orlando Pirates when they met on Match Day 2 of the competition in South Africa but relied on head-to-head advantage to sit comfortably at the top of the group. Kalu, in his goodwill message, commended the players and officials of the football club for their superlative skills. He said, “I felicitate with Enyimba FC on their well-deserved victory against Orlando Pirates in the CAF tournament. “The players demonstrated their capability. “The victory of the team is well deserved and encouraging.” According to Kalu who is the Senate Chief Whip and a football enthusiast, the ‘round leather game’ brings people together and ultimately promotes peace and unity. He called on stakeholders in the sports industry in the country to focus on grassroots sports development in order to discover talented players in their prime. Kalu also advocated private sector participation in sports development, adding that sports should not be seen as a leisure activity but business opportunity. It would be recalled that Enyimba FC was repositioned during Kalu’s stint as Governor of Abia state, with the team clinching the CAF Champions League back to back in 2003 and 2004.
