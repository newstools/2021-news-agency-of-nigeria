By  Okuanwan Offiong Nestlé Nigeria on Wednesday commissioned an additional Water and Sanitation project at Salvation Army School 2, Edu, Agbara in Ogun. The facility is expected  to provide access to clean and safe drinking water and sanitation for no fewer than  1,000 more people including educators, learners and families within the community. The school is one of the beneficiaries of Nestlé for Healthier Kids (N4HK), a primary school-based nutrition education program which teaches healthy nutrition, healthy hydration, good hygiene and active lifestyles to over 17,000 children annually. “At Nestlé, we recognise that water is essential for livelihood and wellbeing, particularly in these times where hygiene is critical to curbing the spread of COVID-19. “We are therefore delighted to provide access to clean water and hygiene facilities in one more school within our immediate environment. “We urge the educators and learners at Salvation Army School 2 to make full use of the facilities. “We will continue to focus on ensuring that everyone within our immediate communities has access to clean, potable water,’’ a statement by Nestle quoted him as saying. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that in February 2021, Nestlé had provided water and sanitation facilities at two schools – Oke-Ona United School, Abeokuta and St Paul’s Anglican School, Orile Imo in Obafemi Owode, both in Ogun. With the addition of this new facility at Salvation Army School 2, Edu Agbara, over 17,000 people living in the communities around Nestlé’s factories in Ogun and Abaji in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), now have access to clean and safe water. In his address at the inauguration, the Commissioner for Education in Ogun, Prof. Abayomi Arigbabu said, “This contribution to the welfare of the leaders of tomorrow is highly commendable, and we do not take it for granted. “Your consistent efforts to add value through the provision of water and sanitation facilities in schools within Ogun  is highly appreciated. “ The addition of yet another facility at Salvation Army Primary School 2, Edu, Agbara is indeed a welcome support to this administration led by Prince Dapo Abiodun,’’ he said. Also speaking at the inauguration, Dr Femi Majekodunmi, Board Chairperson of Ogun State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) said: “Today’s event is another milestone in our collective drive to further improve the state of personal hygiene in our schools and society at large. “ I am therefore glad to note that the project which consists of VIP toilets, a borehole and a 2,000 litre capacity overhead storage tank all at Salvation Army Primary School 2, Edu Agbara, Ado Odo/Ota Local Government Area are timely and built to world-class standards. “I wish to also charge the school management, staff and our esteemed learners to make good use of the facilities through proper maintenance to motivate the donors as well as others to do more.” He commended Nestlé Nigeria Plc for the laudable intervention in addition to the earlier executed facilities. NAN also reports that community leaders, dignitaries as well as the administrators, educators and learners of Salvation Army School 2, expressed delight at finally having water and good toilet facilities within the school premises. Nestlé Nigeria has led actions to provide clean and safe water in communities closest to its operations in Ogun State and Abaji within the FCT. The company’s interventions support the Sustainable Development Goal 6 – ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. An estimated 100 million Nigerians still lack basic sanitation facilities and 63 million do not have access to improved sources of drinking-water, underscoring the need for consistent multi-stakeholder action to increase access.
