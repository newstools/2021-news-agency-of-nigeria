By George Odok The Vice Chancellor of the University of Calabar, Prof. Florence Obi, has called on the Nigerian Army, Navy and the Maritime Police to always maintain a steady presence at sea to enhance security in the state. Obi made the call on Monday when the Commandant of the Nigerian Army Amphibious Training School, Calabar, Brig.-Gen. Joshua Nimmyel, paid her a courtesy call in her office in Calabar. The VC explained that steady presence of security personnel along the Calabar channel would prevent hoodlums from using the river to get entrance into the University. She lamented that the porous nature of the river beside the University had continue to pose a security challenge to the University community. According to her, most of the suspected kidnappers that have gain entrance into the institution to either kidnap or rob staff came through the river side. “As an institution, we are ready to collaborate with relevant security agencies that are patrolling the waterways.  “The University of Calabar is situated beside the river side and this is our biggest challenge because suspected kidnappers now gain entrance through the river side to get into the University and commit all sort of crime. “I want to plead with you to always use the river side beside the University for your practical and training with a view to scare these suspected kidnappers and hoodlums that are terrorising the peace of the University. “We are looking forward to see that a policy is formulated that will constantly mandate security agencies to always patrol the waterways,” she said. The VC told the Commandant that they can also partner in the area of research and training for their personnel where necessary. She commended the Commandant for contributing largely to the security provision in the state, pleading that such gesture should also be extended to the University’s community. Earlier, the Commandant said that the aim of the call was to create a synergy between the military training institution and the University. According to him, the Amphibious Training School was saddled with the responsibility of training military and paramilitary officers on amphibious and riverine security and policing. He said that such collaboration would foster security provision, training and research for both the University and the Amphibious Training School. He congratulated Obi for emerging as the first female VC of the 46-year old institution, describing her emergence as “historic”.
