By Douglas Okoro At least 100 youths in Uburu, Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi, were on Monday trained in agribusiness and mentorship by Uburu Amaka Humanitarian Organisation. The Executive Administrator of the organisation, Mr Nicholas Onu, said the programme was designed to transfer modern agricultural skills to youths of the area. Onu said the training was organised in collaboration with Globetrot Farmsponsor Nigeria Limited. He said that the overall aim was to empower and make the youths of the area self-reliant. He appealed to corporate organisations and well-meaning individuals to contribute their quota toward job creation, saying that government could not do it alone. Onu said the programme was an offshoot of a youth summit, which took place in the area in January 2021. He further appealed to the state government and other stakeholders to assist the organisation to raise the resources needed to execute some of their programmes. The Chief Executive Officer, Globtrot Farmsponsor Nigeria Ltd., Mr BillKeneth Akpa, said the training was part of the corporate social responsibility of the organisation. Akpa said that their aim was to ensure that young people in the area were directed to the best way possible to make a good living. “Youths shy away from farming because they feel that agriculture is dirty and tedious. “However, technology has made farming much easier for one to get up to 300 per cent return on investment,” he said. In a goodwill message, the Commissioner for Business Development, Dr Steven Odo, appealed to the participants to focus on the different stages of agribusiness value chain. Odo said the state had comparative advantage in agriculture due to its abundant human and natural resources. He said government had a deliberate policy to promote agriculture and youth empowerment in the state. “That is what we call ‘One man, one hectare land policy’. “As a government appointee, you have to show that you are promoting government’s policy on agriculture,” Odo said.
