By Olawale Alabi Enyimba International Football Club of Aba advanced to the quarter-finals of the 2020/2021 CAF Confederation Cup alongside visiting Orlando Pirates of South Africa on Wednesday. Cyril Olisema’s goal in added time of second half gave Enyimba a 1-0 win at the Enyimba International Stadium in Aba. The win ensured Enyimba upstaged the South African side at the top of Group A table to advance as group winners on head-to-head advantage. Enyimba had lost 1-2 to Orlando Pirates when they met on Match Day 2 of the competition, but Wednesday’s 1-0 win was enough advantage for the Aba side. Both sides had finished on nine points each after six matches, but head-to-head calculation came in to separate both sides. They both go into Friday’s quarter-finals draw to know their next opponents. In the other Group A encounter, ES-Setif of Algeria seen as the ‘underdogs’, surprisingly defeated Al-Ahly of Libya, 1-0 but could not progress further having secured only eight points from six matches, while the Libyan side ended up with seven points. Both teams however, did not progress to the quarter-finals stage. The other qualifiers for the quarter-finals are Raja Casablanca of Morocco, Coton Sport of Cameroon, JS Kabylie of Algeria, ASC Jaraaf of Senegal, CS Sfaxien of Tunisia and Pyramids of Egypt.
