By Lucy Ogalue The Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC) has urged Port Health Services to maximise time in port clearance and implement the Nigerian Ports Process Manual (NPPM) for port system efficiency in the country. Mr Hassan Bello, NSC’s Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, made the call when he visited the Director of Port Health Services, Ministry of Health, Dr Geoffery Okatubo, on Friday in Abuja. Bello stressed that cargoes dwell time should be within three to seven days as against 20 to 21 days. “So, we want just like any agency for the port health to be conscious of time. Time is of the essence in port clearance. So, when they board the ship it should be as soon as the ship arrives. “And, it should be for a minimum number of maybe 30-45 minutes and the number of officers on board should be maximum of three.” He noted that if all these were done it would attract international ship owners to Nigerian ports. According to Bello, there is the need for the NPPM to be owned by relevant agencies and stakeholders to ensure improved port services. “This is an important manual. Our ports have not been doing well, they are improving everyday but there is need for us to own up to what we are supposed to do. “Everybody in the port must have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). We can’t just be there at the ports like heedless chicken running all over. “Everybody has his function, where, how, why and who is to do what function, so that if there is orderliness, efficiency, there will be reduction of corruption,” he said. He described the manual as the bible of port operations, stressing that everybody should abide by the rules. “This SOP was conducted, streamlined by NPA, NSC and many agencies, launched in 2020 by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, but somehow it is not effective because there is nobody to own it. “There is no leadership in that programme, so recently, the Vice President appointed NSC as the lead agency. “And our role is not to do the SOP of anybody but to coordinate, to supervise and see that all these things are being done so that our ports are efficient, so that our ports are not corrupt. “We want an efficient port, reason being that we are in competition with the West and Central African region. “We want all the cargoes to come to Nigeria first, before they are distributed to other countries but now the reverse is the case. “So, we have to clean up our ports and one of the things we have which concerns your authority/services is the port health,’’ he said. In his response, the director of port health services assured the NSC of the services support, especially to ensure reduction in the Corruption Perception Index. On turnaround time, Okatubo said the time agreed on the manual was sufficient but appealed that it should relaxed for now due to the COVID-19 pandemic and guidelines. “The time you mentioned is very okay by us but in this season of COVID-19, there are certain port health activities, we are supposed to carry out, particularly for any ship that is coming in for the first time. `So, for this period I want to appeal to you, let’s not follow that strictly because for now, there are certain countries we are very much interested in; Brazil, South Africa and India. “I want to assure you that port health is solidly behind you. We are with you and will do everything to support you to reduce the corruption perception index of the ports,’’ Okatubo added.(NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
