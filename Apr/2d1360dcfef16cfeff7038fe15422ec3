By Muftau Ogunyemi A development organisation, Diamond Group of Nigeria, has urged the Federal Government to deploy technology such as drone surveillance to tackle the rampant banditry and kidnappings across the country. The group also said that it has become imperative for the government to collaborate with neighbouring countries, including seeking foreign help, to deal decisively with the worsening security challenges. Mr Toyyib Musa-Omoloja, Diamond spokesperson,  made the call in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)  in Akure. The group, which claims to be a development organisation with social and political orientation, attributed the security challenges facing the country to its porous borders and difficult terrains. It also attributed what it to what it called “anemic’’ security architecture and controversial peace agreements between some states and criminal groups. According to the group, in view of the alarming spike in insecurity in the country in recent time, non-state actors are apparently dictating the pace. “We are alarmed at the rate of death being recorded daily, the arson and destruction of symbols of government and governance in some parts of the country. “While the Northeast is perennially under the sword of fake jihadists and insurgents, the Northwest is under the yoke of bandits. “The Niger Delta is home to piracy and organised crimes while the rest of the country is battling with herders-farmers crises of no mean proportion. “The Southeast and Southwest have become more strident in their calls for secession. What a trying period for Nigeria and Nigerians. “So, we are of the opinion that without a thorough diagnosis of the causes of this insecurity incubus, prescribing effective solution will be a mirage,” the group said. The group, who called on President Muhammadu Buhari to do the needful before it is too late, said government should provide employment and stimulate the economy through strategic human and infrastructural development.
