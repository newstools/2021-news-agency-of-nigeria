By Oluwabukola Akanni The Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) says that the high number of preventable  malaria-related deaths recorded in the country is unacceptable. In a statement signed by its national president, Ladi Bala, and national secretary, Helen Udofa, on Sunday, NAWOJ decried the high rate of malaria-related mortalities in the country in the recent past. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that World Malaria Day is marked annually on April 25. “According to the 2019 World Malaria Report, Nigeria had the highest number of global malaria cases in 2018 and accounted for the highest number of deaths,” NAWOJ noted. The association said that the figure was alarming and unacceptable. The body noted that this year’s theme, “Zero Malaria, Draw the Line Against Malaria,” was an indication that malaria is preventable and that, therefore, every malaria death is unacceptable. NAWOJ stated that as a country that bears the brunt of the malaria burden, Nigeria should, therefore, be leading the cause to stamp out malaria by 2030. “If we are aiming for zero malaria by this year, there is the need for a strong primary health care system that must ensure access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment. “There is a dire and urgent need for the Federal Government to develop a strong political will toward eliminating malaria in the country. “As individuals, we must also take personal responsibility to eliminate malaria in the country, zero malaria begins with every Nigerian,” the women journalists said. The body called on women groups, non governmental organisations and other concerned bodies to intensify advocacy and awareness campaigns toward eliminating malaria in the country.
