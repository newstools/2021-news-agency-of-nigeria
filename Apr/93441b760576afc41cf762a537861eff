By Rukayat Moisemhe  The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), on Thursday, said its three newly accredited laboratories would boost the nation’s manufacturing sector and increase its level of exports.  Mallam Farouk Salim, Director-General, SON made the assertion at the unveiling of the laboratories by American A2LA body, in Lagos.  Salim said that the accreditation would also help reduce the rejection of Nigerian agricultural products at the international market, since the products certified and tested in the accredited laboratory would receive global acceptance.  “Most manufacturers have said their products were being rejected, even by our local companies because their products were not certified.  “This is because they do not have laboratory certificate to say that they are up to standard,  “Right now, that excuse is out of the way and also because of the export potentials of our industries, with the certification, it will be easy for them to export anywhere in the world.  “An accredited laboratory gives the nation credibility, gives our manufacturers credibility, and saves our foreign exchange. This is because they do not have to go to neighboring countries to get their products certified anymore, so it is a win-win situation for everybody.  “We are allowed to export to the United States of America now with the accreditation and any other country in the world, so it makes things easier because there is legitimacy and authentication.  “The consumers abroad will have the confidence to buy goods coming from Nigeria, because the certification shows that the goods have been tested and verified for consumption,” Salim said.  Salim revealed plans to establish more laboratories in the country so as to ensure that goods can be tested nationwide.  He enjoined stakeholders in the industry to contribute their quota in the quest to build more world class laboratories in the country.  “Our main plan is that in every state, there should be some laboratory activity, to minimize people travelling from one state to another because of testing.  “The three laboratories are a step forward, especially with the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in full force,” he said.  In her remarks, Dr Adebukola Huthman, Deputy Director, Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi, (FIIRO), commended the standards body on the accreditation, describing it as a ”no mean feat” in a country like Nigeria.  “I know what you had to go through to achieve this, but to go ahead to meet the tough requirements means that SON has done lots of beautiful work.  ”And it also shows that their results have a lot of integrity and there is high confidence in their result.  “An accredited laboratory means that Nigeria has the same standards with other countries in the world and SON’s laboratories are among the very few accredited laboratories in the world,” she added.  Also, Mr Emmanuel Odega, Head, Planning, Research and Statistics, Institute of Public Analysts of Nigeria (IPAN), said the accreditation assured that Nigerian goods were of the same quality with any other country in the world.  He added that it would not only  boost the economy, but also help to earn foreign exchange for the country.  Mr Jude Maduka, Executive Secretary, Paints Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (PMAN), said the accreditation would ensure that made-in-Nigeria goods competed favourably in the AfCFTA, as well as strengthen SON’s testing capabilities.
