Chadian communication minister and government spokesperson Cherif Mahamat Zene on Monday called on the population to stay calm after fierce clashes between the army and rebels over the weekend. “I want by my voice to reassure that there is nothing, absolutely nothing that can justify the panic that a part of the population is seized with because of the malicious propaganda on social networks. “I, therefore, appeal for calm,” Mahamat Zene twitted. More than 300 fighters were killed and 150 others, including three top leaders, taken prisoner on Saturday in Chad’s western Kanem province, a Chadian army spokesperson said on Monday. This came after a raid by the Front for Alternation and Concord in Chad (FACT), an armed rebel group based in neighboring Libya, according to local media. The battleground is some 300 km north of the capital N’Djamena. On Monday, security in the capital city was beefed up with tanks deployed in major strategic positions. “The establishment this morning of a security system in certain parts of the capital seems to be misinterpreted. “There is no particular threat to fear,” Mahamat Zene said.
