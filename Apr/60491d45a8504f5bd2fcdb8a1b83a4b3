By Segun Giwa Sunshine Queens Football Club of Akure on Tuesday in Ijebu-Ode defeated Edo Queens of Benin 2-1 at the 2020/2021 Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) Premiership Super Six. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Delta Queens had defeated Edo Queens 2-1, while Sunshine Queens drew 1-1 with Bayelsa Queens on Match Day 1 of the competition. In the Match Day 2 fixture played at the main bowl of the Dipo Dina Stadium, midfielder Suliat Abideen gave Sunshine Queens the lead in the seventh minute. She scored with a brilliant free-kick from 25 yards out. Elizabeth Zirike responded for Edo Queens by scoring against her former club with a strike from outside the area to make the scoreline 1-1. However, Sunshine Queens did not allow Edo Queens enjoy the moment for long with a goal by Abigail Sunday from Aminat Yakubu’s low cross in the 22nd minute. It was Sunday’s second goal of the competition. The game, in spite of so much intensity in the second half, could not produce any other goal and the game ended 2-1 in favour of Sunshine Queens. Sunshine Queens’ Head Coach, Wemimo Mathew, later said she was happy with the result and the performance of her players. Mathew said her tactics were gradually paying off and it was an improvement from the first match of the competition. “I am happy. It is a normal thing that any other team feels when they get three points. Our tactics are working gradually, but there are other areas we still need to work on,” she said. On her part, the Edo Queens’ Head Coach, Stanley Osaze, said losing their second game of the competition was not the result his team wanted. “Two losses from two games is not a good thing, and the team are not happy. The girls are not happy and the management is not happy. “In football, some time you play well and you just lose. But we are going to work on doing better in the next game and see what happens,” he said. NAN reports that Sunshine Queens now have four points from two matches, while Edo Queens are yet to pick a point.
