By Martha Agas The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Plateau Council, recently organised training for its members to enlighten them about the COVID-19 vaccine.The sensitisation became necessary because of the conspiracy theories, popularised since the COVID-19 vaccine became available globally and in Nigeria. The training was designed to equip journalists as information managers with appropriate information in order to adequately and properly educate the people. The training was facilitated by the Plateau House of Assembly Committee on Health. Mr Daniel Listick, Chairman of the House Committee on Health who spoke, dispelled the rumour that the vaccine has chips and changes DNA composition. “The vaccine does not contain chips as people are saying. People say the vaccine will change their DNA and cause infertility, there is nothing like that, all these myths are not true, “ he said. He said building the capacity of journalists in partnership with the House, will play a significant role in improving their reporting skills in disseminating appropriate information to the public on the disease. “ After taking the vaccine, I was okay, but others may have reactions, there are experts on ground that once this happens they know what to do, `he said. Also, various speakers at the launching of the COVID-19 vaccination in Plateau, debunked the conspiracy theory and appealed to the people to make themselves available for vaccination. Leading the pack, Gov. Simon Lalong said the conspiracy theories being propagated especially in the social media, is aimed at discouraging people to accept the vaccine. Lalong said that, he, the wife, his deputy, religious and traditional leaders, took the vaccine to show example and dispel fears of various myths attached to it. “It is important to note that the vaccine has been approved by the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organisation, based on global clinical trials, involving 23,000 participants. “In addition, Nigerian regulators such as National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) evaluated the vaccines upon arrival in the country. “All of these evaluations have concluded that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective. “Let me reiterate that no one will be compelled to take the vaccine as the administration is totally voluntary. “However, I wish to remind our citizens that the law criminalising the denial of COVID-19 in Plateau State is still in force. “Therefore, those who want to engage in spreading conspiracy theories and mobilising others against taking the vaccine will not be allowed. “ I want to reassure our people that as your governor, I will not subscribe to anything that will harm you nor affect your well-being, rather, my number one priority is to ensure your safety and good health,“ he said. Rev.Fr. Polycarp Lubo, the State Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) who spoke, said that those who had COVID-19 disease can testify of the hardship they experienced. He said that the arrival of the vaccine certified by NAFDAC will address the challenges posed by the scourge. “ We should encourage those people who are doubting to come and receive the vaccine. I think the vulnerable people should be considered first,’’ he said. Similarly, State Chairman of Jama’atu Nasril Islam, Alhaji Muhammadu Muhammadu, said he received the vaccine to demonstrate leadership by example. He decried the proliferation of many misleading information on the vaccine and assured the government that leaders will continue to support their policies and programmes. Prof Edmund Banwat, the Chief Medical Director, Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH), said the vaccine administered to political leaders is a bold step to address the myths surrounding the vaccine and show it is safe. “If it is not safe, these political leaders would not avail themselves to take the vaccine. The vaccine is critical to end the pandemic, ‘’he said. Mr Williams Wadzingi, Plateau Coordinator, World Health Organisation (WHO), said enlightenment is critical to the  success of the vaccination. Dr Innocent Emmanuel, the Chairman, Nigerian Medical Association (NMA),  Plateau Chapter, who spoke in an interview, said the COVID-19 disease has led to loss of lives, ravaged communities and caused so much havoc on the economy, “so the vaccine is critical to win the war against the disease.’’ He explained that the vaccine initially had some controversies, which prompted some countries to stop its usage, but the situation has been addressed in the affected countries. “ It has now been confirmed that the vaccine is safe, the issue of blood clots earlier associated with the vaccine was proved to be false. “The countries have already agreed that the vaccine should be re-administered to their people. “ The United Nations has said its safe and this has been tested and even countries that were having problems with the vaccine have now agreed that people can be vaccinated,“ he said. Emmanuel urged the government to involve critical stakeholders, particularly community and religious leaders, to ensure people get information on the vaccine. The chairman said that visits to schools to enlighten students and the engagement of media houses at all levels will help in dispelling the myths of the vaccine. Rev. Chris Damcher, the State Coordinator, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) on HIV AIDs and Other Health Related Matters,  said COVID-19 disease has affected many households. He said that the vaccine is a relief, though not without its challenges. The coordinator said that government involving CSOs in sensitisation campaigns on the disease and vaccine would have the desired impact, as rural people perceive the disease as a “ city issue.’’ (NANFeatures) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
