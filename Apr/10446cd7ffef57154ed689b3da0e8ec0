By Ifeanyi Nwoko Ms World United Nations, Queen Hadassah Allaputa, has launched a new family pageant aimed at improving humanitarian services and contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The pageant launched in Abuja on Friday and tagged ‘United Nation’s Pageants Nigeria’ will draw participants from the six geo-political zones to jostle for eight titles. Briefing newsmen at the launch of the pageant, Allaputa said that the pageant was different from the regular ones and would focus more on training and development of participants for the betterment of their communities. The beauty queen said that in stead  of having only one winner who would fade out at the end of her  one-year reign, the new pageant would  have eight winners who would hold their titles and perform their roles for life. “Today is the official launch of the United Nation’s Pageants Nigeria, the biggest family pageants, the biggest ever in Nigeria because of its size and the number of pageants under it. “We would be having eight categories of contestants from different age groups and genders; this complete family pageant will have contestants for eight titles. “They will be trained, equipped and empowered to become kings and queens, princes and princesses of the United Nations Pageant,” she said. Allaputa said that successful contestants would  serve as role models and ambassadors, carrying out particular SDGs. “Apart from its size, one thing that makes this truly unique is that it is aimed at empowering Nigerians across different geo-political zones. “That is why our tag line is Uniting Nigeria through pageantry. “All contestants will be trained to creatively function in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. “They will be taught peace and conflict resolution, etiquette and image branding, humanitarian services as well as persuasive communication and effective leadership skills.” The beauty queen,  who is also the Founder, Queen Hadassah Legendry, said that winners who would become part of the UN Royal Family and must acquire the skills to be part of the family. She said that the skills would be taught to all participants and they would be expected to go back to their communities to implement tasks to improve the lives of those in the communities. “I want to change the narrative and educate both participants and Nigerians that beauty pageantry is more than a hobby or a show of beauty. “This is a life-time call to service, winners will be reoriented to see pageantry as an act of service that they will take seriously for life. “Usually, most winners complete their reign and they are forgotten and nobody remembers them as kings or queens, but this time, they will be groomed to be legends,” she said. She said that winners would  continue to channel their works toward community services, protecting the environment and advancing the development of their motherland. According to Allaputa, enrolment has already begun and interested participants urged to visit the website www.unitednationspageantsnigeria.org. “Registration starts immediately and I am inviting all Nigerians to be part of this historic event,” she said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some of the categories to be contested in are  Mrs Nigeria United Nations, Mr Nigeria United Nations, Miss Nigeria United Nations, Ms Nigeria United Nations, Mr Teen United Nations and Miss Teen Nigeria United Nations.
