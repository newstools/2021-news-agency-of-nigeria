By Okon Okon The  National Coordinator SERVICOM,Mrs Nnenna Akajemeli, says the essence of governance can only be realised when effective and improved service is delivered to the people. Akajemeli said this at a 2-day SERVICOM training of desk officers on Open Government Partnership (OGP) initiative tagged, “Charter Development/Review Workshop for OGP Pilots MDAs” on Tuesday in Abuja. SERVICOM is The Service Compact with all Nigerians She said that the workshop objective was to strengthen SERVICOM efforts towards improvement in service delivery processes in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Akajemeli said the workshop also aimed at improving service delivery to citizens. ”OGP came as a global coalition of reformers from government and civil society, working to make government more transparent, participatory/accountable by truly serving and empowering citizens. ”Seven pilot ministries were carefully selected to kick-start the OGP initiative, this includes Ministry of Education, Transport, Agricultural and Rural Areas, Health, Power, Works and Housing and Aviation. “The essence of governance can only be realised when service truly served the people and so one singular tool that can bring about this improvement is the service charter,” she said According to her, part of what has been identified is that some of the organisations have not written proper service charters. “And, that is why we are here to train, to fill the gaps, identify training gaps to update our knowledge, to begin to get it done right. “And, that is what makes the difference between us – developing nations and the developed nations,” she said. Akajemeli said that OGP was an initiative that presented a platform for co-creation, partnership and collaboration between governments (State Actors), Civil Society Organisations and the private sector (Non-State Actors), in achieving the OGP developmental process. Mrs Obialunanma Nnaobi, one of the participants, at the training said that proper handling of public service delivery was critical to improving lives and livelihood. According to her, proper handling of service delivery can help to achieve SERVICOM set goals. ”OGP will be useful for agencies to proactively reach out to each other, aligning plans, processes and frameworks while carrying the public along,” she said. Also speaking, Mr Adamu Bashir, a Non-State Actor Co-Chairman, expressed appreciation to the management team of SERVICOM for its tremendous services to the nation. Bashir tasked the participants at the workshop on the usage of the acquired knowledge at the end of the exercise to improve services to the nation and the citizenry. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that OGP is a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from national and sub-national governments to promote open government, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies, to strengthen governance across the globe, Nigeria inclusive. NAN also reports that the workshop attracted participants from CSOs, non-state actors and SERVICOM Desk Officers from the selected MDAs.
