By Afusat Agunbiade-Oladipo  Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara says manufacturing is an important means of reducing unemployment in Nigeria.  AbdulRazaq made the observation on Monday in Ilorin while receiving the Director-General of Standard Organisation of Nigeria(SON), Alhaji Farouk Salim.  Represented by his deputy, Mr Kayode Alabi, the governor said manufacturers should receive more support from government to produce international standard products, thereby boosting exports and creating jobs.  AbdulRazaq assured that his administration would encourage small and medium scale businesses, and partner SON to uphold standards.  Salim had earlier said he was in the state to inaugurate the organisationâ€™s new office complex and inspect some manufacturing companies in the state.  He said the organisation would sign a memorandum of understanding with the state government to educate small scale industries on standard products.  The director-general appealed to the state government to provide supportive infrastructure to manufacturers and other businesses in the state.
