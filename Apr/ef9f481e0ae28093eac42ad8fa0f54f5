According to him, his administration will not relent in its efforts towards ensuring that the state is free from such illicit products, and drug abuse among the youths. “We will make sure that the state is not only dropping from the high position in drug abuse in the country, but that it’s free from drug abuse. “We are working towards the establishment of a law that would ensure that those engaged in selling fake, substandard, adulterated, expired and unwholesome products are brought to book with serious punishment, ” Ganduje said.

And those items we seized are so dangerous to health.” he said. Dan’agundi further commended  Ganduje for approving the recruitment of 100 casual staff, with the release of their one year allowances to the CPC. According to him, “When I became the acting MD, I realised that there was never a time the CPC received up to N10 million. but during my stay, the governor has released N50 million for us to carry out our assignment. The acting MD further commended all security agencies for supporting the council towards achieving its set objectives.
