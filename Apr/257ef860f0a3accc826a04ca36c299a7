By Shedrack Frank The Bayelsa Government has reassured the Nigerian Army and other security agencies of its commitment and support in the fight against crime and criminality in the state. The Deputy Governor, Mr Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo gave the assurance on Saturday at a send-forth party, in honour of the outgone Commander, 16 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Brig.-Gen. Ephraim Essien in Yenagoa. The deputy governor said the state government would do everything within its reach to assist the military and other security agencies in the state to perform their duties. He described Essien as a thoroughbred professional whose services contributed to the successful swearing in and take-off of the present administration in the state. Ewhrudjakpo noted that Essien assumed leadership of the brigade at a time Bayelsa was experiencing remarkable turbulence, following the Supreme Court judgment on its 2019 governorship election. He said the brigade, working in concert with other security services, helped to calm the turbulence at the time and also prevented the #EndSARS protest from wreaking havoc in the state. While thanking the celebrator for his meritorious services to the Nigerian army and the state, the deputy governor wished  Essien greater success in his new posting. “Even after our swearing in, you and your men were able to contain a few skirmishes that tried to rear up their ugly heads in this state. “So, I want to thank you for your show of professionalism and competence,” he said. The deputy governor also used the opportunity to welcome the incoming commander, Brig.-Gen. Olurotimi Awolo, to the state and urged him to consolidate on the achievements of his predecessor. In his remarks, the Chief of Staff, 16 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Yenagoa, Col. Sani Usman, pointed out that Essien assumed office as the fourth commander of the brigade on Jan. 8, 2020. Usman said the outgone commander made remarkable impacts in the areas of personnel training, operations and infrastructural development in Camp Tukur Buratai Barracks. In their goodwill messages, the Paramount Ruler of Elebele Community, Chief Osene David Osene and the Flag Officer Commanding, Central Naval Command, Rear Admiral Kennedy Egbuchulam, extolled the leadership qualities of Essien. Responding, the outgone commander attributed the achievements recorded during his tenure in Bayelsa to “unquantifiable support” from the state government and other security services. Essien, who has been redeployed to the Army Resource Centre, Abuja, also acknowledged the support of men and officers of the brigade, and urged them to extend same to his successor.
