By Kingsley Okoye The Senate on Wednesday held a minute silence to honour Senator Bode Olowoporoku, who died on March 24, after a brief illness at the age of 76. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that this followed a point of order raised on his demise by Sen. Biodun Olujimi (PDP-Ekiti ) who read out profile of the late politician. Citing order 43 of the Senate Standing Rules, Olujimi noted that late Olowoporoku who was born in llawe-Ekiti, Ekiti State in 1945 served Nigeria in many capacities. She went further that “He was a thorough-bred scholar-politician who was part of the conclave of the intelligentsia that gave the Unity Party of Nigeria, UPN its ideological foundation and policy direction. “Olowoporoku served exceptionally as Commissioner for Economic Planning and Statistics in Ondo State in 1979 and supervised the creation of most of the industries and commercial investment that the Ajasin administration was reputed for. “Aware that he was consumed with the idea of Ekiti emancipation and development, and so had to painfully part way with the UPN in 1981 because of what he and other Ekiti compatriots who served in the Government of Chief Adekunle Ajasin as governor of Ondo State perceived as injustice to and marginalisation of Ekiti people then. “Aware also that he later politically aligned with the National Party of Nigeria, NPN and was appointed Federal Minister of Science and Technology under the Shagari regime before the military took over government in 1983. “Notes that he was at the forefront in the agitation for the creation of Ekiti, providing extensive funding and also playing a prominent role working with the Council of Ekiti Obas and the committee for the creation of Ekiti, and utilised his robust network through his close friends Olusola Saraki and Adamu Ciroma to meet the Late Abacha for the creation of Ekiti State. “Aware that he served as senator representing Ekiti South Senatorial District between 2003-2007. Due to his love for Ekiti and its people, he offered to serve as the governor of Ekiti on three occasions but as fate would have it, he was not elected. “Notes that he was a nationalist, a proud Ekiti elder statesman and philanthropist. We will miss him dearly for his irreplaceable role as a caring father.”  (NAN) Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Share this:WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket WhatsAppFacebookTwitterTelegramMoreLinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket LinkedInTumblrSkypeRedditPinterestPocket Like this:Like Loading...
