By Abubakar Ahmed The Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) Governors’ Forum and Governor of Kebbi State, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu, on Saturday, paid a condolence visit to Zamfara over the renewed spate of banditry in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that armed bandit attacks had resurfaced in some parts of the state, leading to the death of many people. Bagudu, who was in company with his Jigawa State counterpart, Alhaji Badaru Abubakar, said that they were in the state to commiserate with Gov. Bello Matawalle and the people of the state over the attacks. “We were with Gov. Matawalle in Abuja three days ago to discuss the issue of insecurity with the presidency when he hurriedly left us after receiving reports of attacks on some communities in the state. “Since 2014 when, as senators, we came to Zamfara over the killing of over 90 innocent persons, we thought we had witnessed the last of such unfortunate happening but sadly, the matter has continued to defy measures. “We are here on behalf of APC governors to condole with government and people of Zamfara, especially the immediate family members of those killed and to assure you that we will always be with you in this fight,” Bagudu said. While praying that the attacks would be the last of such, he expressed the hope that the efforts of both the federal and state governments in that regard would be fruitful. Responding, Matawalle thanked the governors for their concern, describing the attacks, which took place in the holy month of Ramadan, as terrible. “I recently discussed extensively the issue of security challenges facing the state with President Muhammadu Buhari and the nation’s service chiefs, all of whom have commended our efforts and promised their continued support. “We have been doing our best and will continue to do it in order to bring lasting peace to the state. The security agencies in the state are also up and doing. “In the next three to four days, we are going to take a new stand and apply some new tactics in addressing the matter,” Matawalle added. The governor called for more support and cooperation from security agencies, even as he sought for credible information from the public so as to achieve the desired objectives.
