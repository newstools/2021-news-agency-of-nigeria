By AbdulFatai Beki A Cleric, Sheikh AbdulHakeem Oganija, has called on the Nigeria Censors Board to put up stiffer penalty for film producers who promote  nudity in their films. According to him, the measure will encourage producers to make positive movies that will promote decency  and instill good morals in the  younger generation. Oganija, who is a Missioner of Zarumi Alanamu Mosque in llorin West Local Government Area of Kwara, made the call on Monday  during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin. According to him, several promiscuous films have damaged the moral upbringing of many young boys and girls who are supposed to become responsible leaders of the country. “The Censors Board needs to wake from its slumber to eradicate promiscuity and other destructive tendencies from film productions, to protect the good image of the country,” he said. The cleric urged the Federal Government to give the Nigerian Censor Board enabling environment that will make them discharge their duties optimally. The Islamic cleric suggested that the board should have offices in all the states of the federation. According to him, this will make it have easier access to markets in order to get rid of several films with nudity that are being sold. Oganija called on parents and guardians to always caution their children against engaging in immoral acts especially during this Ramadan period. “This will encourage them to earn the reward of the Ramadan season,” he said.
