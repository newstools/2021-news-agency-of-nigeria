IOM By Oladele Eniola Mr Franz Celestin, Chief of Mission, International Organisation for Migration (IOM), on Wednesday, reiterated the organisation’s commitment to support the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Person (NAPTIP) in the fight against human trafficking and irregular migration. Celestine spoke in Lagos at the launch of a Traveling Awareness Raising Exposition Project and handing over ceremony of a bus to NAPTIP. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the awareness raising exposition project is a collaboration between the Swiss Confederation, IOM and NAPTIP. He noted that the bus would help in creating awareness in the fight against human trafficking in various communities in the country. “Human trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants are serious crimes and, as such, should not go unpunished. However, impunity is such that it is more profitable for criminals to traffic in human beings than in small arms. “This $150 billion per annum criminal enterprise presents high profits, with low risks do the traffickers, so, scaling up efforts in the criminal justice response is of utmost importance to increase the number of investigations, prosecutions and convictions. “We are committed to ensuring that we create and spread awareness of this crime to all communities, especially those at the grassroots level, so this blue bus would go a long way in ensuring that it happens. “The bus would help NAPTIP officials to travel to various communities in the country to raise awareness of the dangers of human trafficking and how to ensure that we eradicate this menace from the society” he said. He explained that the bus was fully equipped with all the tools and machinery needed to help in creating awareness of the people in various communities. Celestin said that the project would start with communities in Lagos, Edo and Delta before commencing in other states in the country. “Through continuous support and partnership, the IOM purchased and designed an awareness raising travelling exposition bus, fully equipped with audio visual and written information, to address the risks and challenges associated with human trafficking. “The blue bus is a one-stop venue where vulnerable migrants, as well as community members can get information on the risks associated with trafficking in persons, where to report cases and counseling on the spot,” he said. He commended the Federal Government for the framework put in place to effectively manage migration, trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants. Mr Thomas Schneider, Consul General of Switzerland, in Lagos, noted that creating awareness was imperative in the fight against human trafficking. “We are committed and determined to create awareness of people all over the country, because most of them don’t know the consequences of illegal migration. “When people migrate to countries illegally, they think they are going to paradise, but it is always the exact opposite because as an illegal migrant you can’t have a normal life and most times, you have to hide. “Creating awareness is vital because most people don’t know about all these things, so the traffickers use that weakness to exploit them,” he said. Mr Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, Director General, NAPTIP commended the Swiss Government and IOM for the project. Represented by Mr Hassan Tahir, Director, Legal and Prosecution, NAPTIP, Sulaiman-Ibrahim assured that the officers would use the bus to maximum effect. “The blue bus project would take our messages to all states of the federation, since no state is spared in the crime and also to interact with high risk groups so as to provide them protection,” he said.
