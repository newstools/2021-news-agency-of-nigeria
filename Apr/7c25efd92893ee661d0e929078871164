According to Yemi-Esan, the main objective of SOPs is to develop an effective system that complies with industry-specific regulations and standards to significantly reduce or avoid operational errors as well as unwanted work variations. She said that SOPs would also ensure the repeatability and consistency of the performance of any type of process, helps employees to perform complicated tasks. The HOS explained further that in the era of technological advancement and digitalisation, the civil service could not afford to lag behind or operate in isolation and could not continue to do things in the old order and expect new results. She said HOCSF office had decided to take the lead and has gone further to approve the immediate Service-wide development of SOPs starting with four selected MDAs as a pilot. “These MDAs are Federal Civil Service Commission, Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, State House and the Federal Ministry of Transportation. “To keep abreast, therefore, civil service must continue to be dynamic and innovative. “What we are witnessing here today, therefore, is a clear testament of our resolve to embrace new ways of doing things that promote the delivery of services in an effective and efficient,” HOS explained. Speaking earlier before making the presentation of the document, the AIG Chairman said that the initiative was not only important to HOCSF but also to AIG and the entire civil service sector of the country.
