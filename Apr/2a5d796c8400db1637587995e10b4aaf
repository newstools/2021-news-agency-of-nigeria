By Olukayode Babalola The Nasarawa chapter of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) has called for the revival of school sports competition in the state. This is contained in a communique drafted by its members, Eche Amos, Smah George and Esther Akaa, after the association’s monthly congress, held on Wednesday, in Lafia. According to the communique, the SWAN congress called for the revival of school sports across the state for talent discovery and to boost students’ academic performance. The congress congratulated Team Nasarawa for their outstanding performance at the recently concluded Edo 2020 National Sports Festival (NSF), where they won 22 medals. The congress also commended the Governor of Nasarawa, Abdullahi Sule, for his unfettered support for sports and youth development, urging him to sustain the tempo. “We also salute the various sporting initiatives of the Nasarawa State Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, headed by the Commissioner, Othman Bala-Adam, in raising athletes for national and international podium appearance,” it said. The congress then condemned the robbery attack on one of the buses of Team Nasarawa at Akeleku village, near Lafia, while returning from the NSF in Edo. “We use this opportunity to salute the bravery of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps escort personnel and driver for saving the lives of the contingents,” read the communique. The congress, however, appealed to the state government to increase security checkpoints on the Lafia-Makurdi expressway to curb the incessant robbery cases along the route. To usher in a new leadership for the association, the congress set up a three-man committee to conduct the state chapter’s election within the next two weeks.
