By Muhyideen Jimoh The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr Sunday Dare has pledged government’s support for Amaju Pinnick, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President’s bid to contest for a seat in the FIFA council election. Dare made the pledge on Tuesday in Abuja when the NFF boss paid him a courtesy visit. He said the Federal Government would give Pinnick all the necessary support to fly Nigeria and Africa’s flag at the highest FIFA decision making council. The minister stressed the need for Pinnick to use his position and connections in CAF and FIFA to help promote and develop Nigeria and Africa football at all levels. Dare said he was happy to see Nigerians aspire to be among the very best in the world, saying it is the way the country can have a say in the committee of football playing nations. Earlier, Pinnick had thanked the minister and the Federal Government for all the support in their bid to reposition Nigerian football. The NFF boss also submitted a letter thanking the Federal Government for all the support given him so far, pledging to be a good ambassador of Nigeria if elected into the FIFA Council. Pinnick who is a current member of CAF Executive Committee also used the occasion to thank Nigerians for all the support since he became NFF president in 2014. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that FIFA Council Election is scheduled for March 12 in Morocco, where Pinnick is vying for the only CAF anglophone slot. The 37-member FIFA Council is the main decision-making body of the world football body that sets the vision for FIFA and global football. NAN also reports that only two Nigerians have risen to the exalted position of FIFA Council members in the past; Dr. Amos Adamu and Oyo Orok Oyo.
