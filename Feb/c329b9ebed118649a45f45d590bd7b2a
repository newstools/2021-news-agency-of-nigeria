Algeria, on Saturday, hailed the formation of an interim executive authority in Libya and assured to cooperate with it to boost stability in the neighbouring country. According to a statement of the Foreign Ministry, “Algeria welcomes the progress that has been reached in the Libyan political dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations through the formation of the interim executive authority. “Algeria also expresses its full readiness to cooperate with it in order to achieve security, stability and the aspirations of the brotherly Libyan people.’’ The positive step is likely “to contribute to ending the state of division and reuniting the Libyan ranks ahead of the key general elections scheduled at the end of the year,’’ it said. Algeria reaffirmed its categorical rejection of “all forms of interference in the internal affairs of Libya, as well as its continuous support for the peace efforts aimed at establishing peace and stability in this brotherly country within a comprehensive approach based on the safeguard of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Libya,’’ it noted. The new interim government for Libya was announced on Friday, following UN-sponsored dialogue forum held in Geneva last week. Abdul Hamid Mohammed Dbeibah was selected as the new Libyan Prime Minister and Mohammad Younes Menfi as President of the Presidency Council. The new authority will present a new government to the House of Representatives within 21 days. (Xinhua/NAN)
