By Kemi Akintokun A former Technical Director of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), retired Navy Commodore Omatseye Nesiama, has been appointed by World Athletics to conduct a Technical Education and Certification System Level 1 Course for Ghanaian Athletics. The course slated to hold in Accra on Feb. 15 is aimed to revamp Ghanaian officials in preparation for international championships they are planning to host. Reacting to the appointment, Nesiama told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday that it was gratifying that his modest effort was being recognised nationally and internationally. “My being able to train and certify Ghanaians in technical officiating would further strengthen the cordial relationship that has existed between Ghana and Nigeria especially in the area of sports. ” One thing I will try and push, going forward, is creating a West African Athletics Circuit where athletes, coaches and technical officials can be engaged in exchanges via the competitions we would be staging. “Since we train together, we can easily share,” he said. NAN reports that Nesiama is a World Athletics certified Lecturer, licensed Athletes Manager and a member of the Confederation of Africa Athletics Technical and Competitions Commission. He has officiated in many International athletics competitions at different times as competition director and technical delegate. (NAN)
