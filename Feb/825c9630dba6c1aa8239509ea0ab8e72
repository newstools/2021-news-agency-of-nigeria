By Desmond Ejibas The International Press Centre (IPC) in Nigeria says it is highly concerned about incessant kidnapping of journalists in the country. IPC Executive Director, Mr Lanre Arogundade said in a statement on Thursday that the latest kidnap of Mrs Chidebere Onyia, a Port Harcourt-based journalist was one too many. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Onyia, a reporter with NTA Port Harcourt was abducted on Tuesday evening by gunmen at Woji Railway area after work. “IPC is concerned on what is now becoming a pattern, and hereby joins the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Rivers, the family of Onyia and all lovers of freedom to demand her unconditional release. “It is a dangerous trend that we are being confronted with and everything must be done to ensure the safety of Onyia,” he said. Arogundade called on security agencies to secure her release and ensure that the perpetrators are apprehended and brought to justice. “The security agencies should bring the perpetrators to justice to serve as deterrent to others who might be contemplating to target journalists. “In view of the earlier kidnapping of Punch journalist, Okechukwu Nnodim in Abuja, IPC, hereby enjoins all journalists in the country to always take safety precautions,” he advised. He also pleaded with the federal and state governments to take seriously the constitutional obligation imposed on them to guarantee the welfare and security of citizens. (NAN)
