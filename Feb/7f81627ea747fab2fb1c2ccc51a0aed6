By Ahmed Abba Senate President Ahmed Lawan on Saturday revalidated his All Progressives Congress (APC) membership at his Gashua constituency in Yobe. Speaking shortly, Lawan described the exercise as essential, saying the first APC membership registration took place 2014. “Since then, we have so many Nigerians who have come of age and wishing to join political parties of their choice and majority of them decided to join APC but they hare not been registered. “This is an opportunity for them to be registered as bonafide members of the party,” he said. Lawan also said the party needed to wipe out names of people who were no longer members of from the party register. “This is because we have names of people who have defected to other political parties and yet their names are in the register of APC. “We cannot continue to carry names of people who have shifted ground,” he said. Lawan said that the registration would be a continuous exercise as the party had targeted more than 100 million members. “This exercise by the way of registration and revalidation, will not terminate at the end of this month or in the first week of March. “This period is only given to provide a symbolic environment for registration and revalidation. “We should not register nothing less than a 100 million Nigerians. “We have every chance and indeed every reason to register more than 100 million Nigerians in this exercise,” Lawan said. He appealed to all members of the party to conduct themselves in a decent manner towards ensuring success of the exercise. “I want to appeal to my party men across the country not in any way try to stop the registration of any Nigerian who wants to be a member of our party. “The party has enough space, enough room to accommodate everyone,” he said.
