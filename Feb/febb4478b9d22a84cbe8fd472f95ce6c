By Esenvosa Izah The Radio, Television, Theatre and Arts Workers (RATTAWU) has  urged relevant authorities to take advantage of the radio for massive information dissemination on COVID-19, especially to rural Nigeria. RATTAWU’s National President, Mr Kabir Tsanni, made the call in a statement on Saturday to commemorate the World Radio Day, marked annually on Feb. 13 with the 2021 theme:  “New World, New Radio”. “Through radio, the precautionary protocols as established by World Health Organisation (WHO) can reach as many people as possible and in their own languages. “Furthermore, the radio is a veritable platform for launching a successful campaign for vaccination against COVID-19,” he said. He also said that the imperative of using radio in the fight against COVID-19 was predicated on the existing legacies radio had in helping during epidemics and disaster management. According to him, the choice of radio in such instances is due to its four essential qualities of being accessibile, less expensive, immediate, and widespread. “For instance, in Burkina Faso, where there are more than 154 active radio stations, 51 of which are community stations and 40 commercial, there has been a 30-minute French Broadcast on COVID-19 every Saturday. “Same amount of time is allotted for broadcast on COVID-19 in Moore, Diola and Buamu languages during the weekdays. As a result of this, the information on COVID-19 is widespread. “Therefore, it is not surprising that the country has very low cases of COVID-19,” Tsanni said. (NAN)
