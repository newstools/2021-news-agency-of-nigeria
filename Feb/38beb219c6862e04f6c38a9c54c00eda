Mala-Buni said this while addressing APC candidates from all the 17 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state in Damaturu on Wednesday. He urged the candidates to remain loyal to the party, even after winning the election. Mala-Buni said that the APC membership registration/validation was one sure way of identifying loyal members. “I want to say that the exercise is an opportunity for renewal of loyalty to the party as well as providing a level playing field for all members of the party to seek for available posts either at the federal, state or local levels. “Yobe is completely an APC state. Therefore all stakeholders should mobilise members to participate in the exercise and strive to ensure that this golden opportunity does not slip through our fingers,” he said. Mala-Buni, represented by his deputy, Alhaji Idi Gubana, commended the stakeholders for conducting a hitch-free primaries that led to the emergence of consensus candidates for the LG poll. He urged the candidates and stakeholders to monitor government programmes and projects in their areas by serving as links between government and the people. “We should not therefore rest on our oars by relying on the popularity of the party and start thinking that we are going to have a walk over in the election. “All stakeholders have collective responsibility to ensure that voters come out en-mass and also tovensure that all APC candidates emerge victorious at the election,” he said.
