By Gami Tadanyigbe Mr Micah Jiba, the Lawmaker representing AMAC/Bwari Federal Constituency on Tuesday,  embarked on inspection tour of 25 intervention projects in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) sponsored in the 2020 Budget. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some of the projects inspected include, a new five block of classrooms with offices and toilets at Piwoyi community, a motorised borehole at Chika, newly installed 500 KVA transformer at Gosa community. Others were a motorised borehole at Ketti community, newly installed 500 KVA transformer at Kurudu army Barack, a motorised borehole at ECWA Bible School Karu and ICT Centre at JSS Nyanya. Jiba during the tour said that the projects were part of fulfilment of some of his campaign promises to improve and enhance the living standards of residents in his constituency. “This is just an inspection tour of the projects requested by members of my constituency which I facilitated in the 2020 Appropriation Act. “I would have hoped that the projects were completed earlier so that I can embark on new ones. “I am happy when our intervention projects are delivered to each locality. That is one of the ways that our people at the grassroots will enjoy dividends of democracy in the territory,” he said. The lawmaker reiterated his commitment to ensuring that people living in the 22 political wards of AMAC/Bwari constituency enjoy democratic dividends in the FCT.
