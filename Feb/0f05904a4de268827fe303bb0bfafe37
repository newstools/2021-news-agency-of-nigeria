By Emmanuel Acha The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Egede, Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State says it has engaged canvassers for its ongoing party revalidation and registration of members. The Special Assistant to the President on Justice Reform Sector and International Relations, Mrs Juliet Ibekaku-Nwagwu disclosed this on Sunday after revalidating her party membership. Ibekaku-Nwagwu, who registered in Egede/Umuoka Ward 002, said that the move was to boost the membership of the party in the area. The special assistant said that by such move, the APC would have more membership in each of the polling units in the area. “We have canvassers that will be going round every market day to get people to register. We are making our people to understand what the APC stands for,” she said. She said the party was doing better in terms of getting the attention of the people of the area than it did in 2014. “The chances of the APC in the state are better because we are now speaking with one voice.
