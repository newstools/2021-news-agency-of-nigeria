Four regions in Italy were placed under stricter restrictions from Sunday due to a rise in the number of Coronavirus infections. The region, include Tuscany, Liguria, Abruzzia and Trentino have been designated so-called orange zones by the Health Ministry, meaning that bars and restaurants have to close and locals cannot leave the area surrounding their homes except in emergencies. The restrictions will be in place for 15 days initially, the ministry said. Most parts of the country are currently considered yellow zones, meaning that the restrictions have been eased. However, the entire country is still under a night-time curfew beginning at 10 pm (2100 GMT). Italian authorities have recorded a total of 2.7 million coronavirus cases over the past year, with some 13,500 new cases being detected over the past 24 hours. (dpa/NAN)
