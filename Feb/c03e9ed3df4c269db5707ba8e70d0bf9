By Ikenna Osuoha Dr Ejike Oji, member, Association for the Advancement of Family Planning (AAFP), has blamed Nigeria’s security challenges on increasing youth population. Oji told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Abuja that about 70 per cent of Nigeria’s population were under 30 years old and that they consisted of the unemployed and the unemployable. “These youths remain a threat to the nation because they can easily be recruited for mischief,’’ he said. Oji also canvassed rigorous family planning as the panacea to the country’s present demographic crisis. He stated that the provision of quality and adequate health care for the population was important in improving the security situation. Oji expressed AAFP’s commitment to the promotion of family planning through strengthened collaboration with civil society organisations. (NAN)
