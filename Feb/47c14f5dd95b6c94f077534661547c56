The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), has filed a complaint with the European Union against video platform TikTok on multiple grounds, including for failing to protect children. In its complaint submitted to the European Commission on Tuesday, BEUC alleges that TikTok which is popular especially among young internet users across the world was breaching EU law. “TikTok fails to protect children and teenagers from hidden advertising and potentially harmful content on its platform,’’ the organisation said in a press release. “TikTok is also potentially failing to conduct due diligence when it comes to protecting children from inappropriate content such as videos showing suggestive content which are just a few scrolls away,’’ according to the press release. BEUC also alleges that the platform’s terms of service are unfair by being unclear. The consumer protection organisation also claims that TikTok’s processing practices of personal data are misleading. “TikTok does not clearly inform its users, especially in a way comprehensible to children and teenagers, about what personal data is collected, for what purpose and for what legal reason,’’ the organisation said.
