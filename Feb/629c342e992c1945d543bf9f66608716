By Ikenna Osuoha An Abuja-based Non Governmental Organisation (NGO), Initiative for Leadership Development and Change (ILDC) has called for concerted efforts by Nigerians to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the country. Chief Ugochukwu Nnam, President of the group, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Monday. Nnam reminded Nigerians that the pandemic is not only real but present and wreaking havoc in the country. He called on Nigerians to always comply with the safety protocols prescribed by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). “The surest way of staying safe from the disease now is to always wear face mask, wash hands at intervals and keep social distance by avoiding crowds. “Government cannot be expected to enforce everything totally because government like others all over the world is managing scarce resources to run the economy,” he said. The ILDC boss who lauded the Federal Ministry of Health and the Presidential Task Force (PTF) for their efforts in containing the pandemic, urged Nigerians to support the efforts. He said that COVID-19 was not idealistic or a mirage as perceived by some people, but had ravaged the country and even killed some people. “We must tell ourselves the truth, days are gone when we used to say or argue that we have not seen a patient of COVID-19 before, now they abound here with their proven symptoms.” Nnam expressed hope that the pandemic would be defeated with the collective efforts of all Nigerians. NAN reports that available record from NCDC indicates that Nigeria has 145,664 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 120,399 discharged, and 1,747 deaths.(NAN)
