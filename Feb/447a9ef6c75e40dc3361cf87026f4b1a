By  Mujidat Oyewole The National Population Commission (NPC) says it will embark on Enumeration Area Demarcation (EAD) exercise in Ifelodun and Moro Local Government Areas of Kwara on Feb. 4. The commission’s Public Relations Officer, Mrs Ganiyat Lawal, disclosed this on Wednesday in Ilorin while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Lawal said that the EAD was a preparatory activity before the actual census enumeration, pointing out that it should not be equated with the census. She said that the same set of people that did the last enumeration exercise would be used, but few changes had been made. “We did two days refresher training for the workers and few people were removed and replaced by more qualified workers,” she said. The spokesperson said that 28 days had been earmarked for the exercise that would commence on  Feb. 4 and end on March 3. She said that the commission held a meeting with the traditional rulers of the two communities, including relevant stakeholders. “We urged them to enlighten the people of the areas on the importance of the exercise. “NPC Federal Commissioner, Alhaji Rasaq Gidado,  spoke to them and they gave an assurance to be cooperative and supportive,” Lawal said. She said that all necessary enlightenment had been done through the right channels, to ensure a hitch-free exercise. NAN reports that similar exercises had taken place in Ekiti, Irepodun and Oke-Ero Local Government Areas of the state on Jan. 20. (NAN)
