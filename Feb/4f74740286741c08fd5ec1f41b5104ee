By Mohammed Tijjani Troops of Operation Thunder Strike, in Kaduna have recovered four AK-47 rifles, believed to be part of arms belonging to a late bandits leader, Nasiru Kachalla. Mr Samuel Aruwan, Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Kaduna State, made the disclosure in a statement issued in Kaduna on Monday. He said the troops recovered the weapons with the aid of local intelligence sources. Aruwan recalled that Kachalla was killed late December 2020 during a clash between his gang and a rival group of bandits in a forest around Kajuru-Chikun Local Government boundary of the state. “The clash was triggered by a dispute over a large herd of rustled cattle,” he added. The commissioner said Kachalla and his gang were involved in several crimes, including high-profile kidnappings, killings and banditry on the Kaduna-Abuja road and also in Chikun and Kajuru areas. He said Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State had commended the security agencies for recovering the weapons and urged them to pursue all available leads to exposing the bandits. (NAN)
